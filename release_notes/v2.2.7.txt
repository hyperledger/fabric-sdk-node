Changes in v2.2.7:

- Transaction objects can be serialized using their serialize() method, and
  later reconstructed using the Contract's deserializeTransaction() method.
  This allows a transaction to be persisted and resubmitted with the same
  transaction ID (and nonce) following a client application restart, and may
  be useful to recover from a client application failure while an in-flight
  transaction is in an indeterminate state as its commit status has not yet
  been observed.
