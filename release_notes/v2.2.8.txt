This release updates dependencies and addresses an issue that could prevent
client applications from stopping cleanly.

Changes in this release:

- When using a Hardware Security Module, the label associated with the slot
  containing the client identity's credentials can be specified instead of
  the slot index. This provides a more robust mechanism for specifying the
  correct HSM slot.
