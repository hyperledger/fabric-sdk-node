Breaking Changes
---------------------

CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29360/ delivers breaking changes to the key-value stores and Cryptosuite classes:
 - Key-value stores no longer initialize the store within the constructor; there is a seperate (async) `initialize` method that contains the initialize logic.
 - Cryptosuite interface is now strictly followed. The `generateKey` method within implementations no longer accepts `ephemeral: true` as an option; the `generateEphemeralKey` method should be used to retrive an ephemeral key.

The 'fabric-client' package transaction based API's have been replace by 'fabric-common'.
'fabric-network' has been refactored to use the new API's of fabric-common.
The 'fabric-client' package chaincode administrative based API's have been removed from
the SDK. Use the CLI to perform channel and chaincode actions.
see https://fabrictestdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_cli.html

'fabric-client' package has been removed from v2 of the Fabric node.js SDK.
