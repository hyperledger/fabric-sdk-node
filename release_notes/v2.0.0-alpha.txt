Release Notes
-------------
The largest change you'll see is an improved lifecycle for managing chaincode
that supports both centralized and decentralized governance models.
The decentralized chaincode governance model enables organizations to come to
agreement on a chaincode before it is made available for interacting with the
ledger. Specifically, a sufficient number of organizations must approve the
definition of a chaincode before it becomes active, as defined by configurable
policies on a Fabric channel.

The v2.0 Alpha also provides Fabric's first native token support for your trial.
Fabric tokens are governed by a UTXO model where tokens can be issued, transferred,
and redeemed. All peers on a channel validate each transaction, ensuring the
transactor's authorization to the tokens and preventing double spends.

Bug fixes and documentation improvements.

Breaking Changes
---------------------

CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29360/ delivers breaking changes to the key-value stores and Cryptosuite classes:
 - Key-value stores no longer initialize the store within the constructor; there is a seperate (async) `initialize` method that contains the initialize logic.
 - Cryptosuite interface is now strictly followed. The `generateKey` method within implementations no longer accepts `ephemeral: true` as an option; the `generateEphemeralKey` method should be used to retrive an ephemeral key.
