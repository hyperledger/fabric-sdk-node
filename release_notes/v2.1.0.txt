Release Notes
-------------

This v2.1.0 release is the latest release of the fabric-node-sdk packages that support Fabric 2.x.

This v2.1.0 release supercedes previous v2.0.0-beta releases. 
The release-1.4 branch is currently LTS, please see the proposed Fabric LTS strategy for more information:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/23

Major changes from v1.4:
 - The fabric-client package has been removed.Â  Client applications should use the Fabric Programming Model APIs from the fabric-network package.
The underlying APIs that interface with the gRPC layer have been reimplemented in the fabric-common package and should not be used directly by client applications.
 - Simplified wallet management, which is portable across SDK languages and with pluggable persistent storage, more information here: https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/main/tutorial-wallet.html
 - New eventing implementation in fabric-network. Client application code can listen for block events using Network.addBlockListener(), 
and listen for contract events using Contract.addContractListener(). The Network object also provides capability to listen for transaction commit events, 
specifically to support the implementation of custom event handlers; more information here: https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/main/tutorial-transaction-commit-events.html
