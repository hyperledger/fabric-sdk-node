Release Notes
-------------
This v2.2.3 version is the latest of the v2.2 long-term support (LTS) release
of the fabric-node-sdk packages that support Fabric 2.x, and supersedes previous
v2.x releases. Please see the Fabric LTS release strategy document for more
information on LTS releases:

If migrating a client application from an earlier version of the API, consult
the migration tutorial for details of potentially breaking changes and recommended actions:

https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/tutorial-migration.html

Major changes from v1.4:

- The fabric-client package has been removed. Client applications should use
  the Fabric Programming Model APIs from the fabric-network package.

- The underlying APIs that interface with the gRPC layer have been
  reimplemented in the fabric-common package and should not be used directly
  by client applications.

- Simplified wallet management, which is portable across SDK languages and
  with pluggable persistent storage. More information can be found here:

  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/tutorial-wallet.html

- New eventing implementation in fabric-network. Client application code can
  listen for block events using Network.addBlockListener(), and listen for
  contract events using Contract.addContractListener(). The Network object
  also provides capability to listen for transaction commit events,
  specifically to support the implementation of custom event handlers. More
  information can be found here:
