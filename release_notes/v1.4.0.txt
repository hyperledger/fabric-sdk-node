Release Notes
-------------

Fabric 1.4.0 introduces a new programming model designed to improve developer
  productivity and ease of use.  Without needing to understand the underlying
  interactions in a fabric network, minimal code can be written to submit
  transactions to the ledger.  A new NPM package `fabric-network` is added
  which contains the classes and methods for writing blockchain enabled
  applications in node.js using javascript or typescript.

Added organizational parameters to the EndorsementHandler to support
  endorsements using the discovery service. Applications may now request
  proposals to be sent to peers in specific organizations, excluded, or given
  priority. This is useful for applications utilizing fabric's discovery
  service that wish to filter the list of peers the service provides. Peers
  may be selected randomly or by ledger height when sending the proposal
  to be endorsed.

Added support for offline private keys. The node application does not have to
  have access to the user's private key.
