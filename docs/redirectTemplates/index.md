# Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js

The Hyperledger Fabric SDK allows applications to interact with a Fabric blockchain network. It provides a simple API to submit transactions to a ledger or query the contents of a ledger with minimal code.

The SDK implements the Fabric programming model as described in the [Developing Applications](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/developing_applications.html) chapter of the Fabric documentation.

- [1.4](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/module-fabric-network.html)


## Install
