## Hyperledger Fabric Protos for Node.js

SDK for writing node.js applications to interact with [Hyperledger Fabric](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

> **Note:** This API is deprecated as of Fabric v2.5. When developing applications for Hyperledger Fabric v2.4 and later, you should use the [Fabric Gateway client API](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/).

This package encapsulates the Protocol Buffer files and generated JavaScript classes for Hyperledger Fabric.

Additional packages are also provided:
1. `fabric-ca-client`, to interact with the fabric-ca to manage user certificates.
2. `fabric-network`, to provide APIs to connect to a Fabric network, submit transactions and perform queries against the ledger.
3. `fabric-common`, encapsulates the common code used by all fabric-sdk-node packages supporting fine grain interactions with the Fabric network to send transaction invocations
