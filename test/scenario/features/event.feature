Feature: Listen to events using a fabric-network
	Background:
		Given I have deployed a tls Fabric network
		And I can create and join all channels from the tls common connection profile
		And I can create a non-discovery gateway named test_gateway as user User1 within Org1 using the tls common connection profile
		Given I can install/instantiate node chaincode at version 1.0.0 named events to the tls Fabric network for all organizations on channel mychannel with endorsement policy 1AdminOr2Other and args [initLedger]

	Scenario: Using a Contract I can listen to contract events emitted by instantiated chaincodes
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to listen for unfiltered create events with listener createValueListener on chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit 5 transactions with args [createValue] for chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		Then I receive 5 events from the listener createValueListener
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to listen for filtered dc events with listener ehDisconnectListener on chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit 10 transactions with args [createValueDisconnect] for chaincode events instantiated on fabric channel mychannel disconnecting the event hub on listener ehDisconnectListener every 5 transactions
		Then I receive 10 events from the listener ehDisconnectListener

	Scenario: Using a Contract I can listen to block events emitted by networks
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to listen for filtered_block_events with listener filteredBlockListener on chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit a transaction with args [createValue] for chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		Then I receive at least 1 events from the listener filteredBlockListener
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to listen for unfiltered_block_events with listener unfilteredBlockListener on chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit a transaction with args [createValue] for chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		Then I receive at least 1 events from the listener unfilteredBlockListener

	Scenario: I can listen to a transaction commit event
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to create a transaction named transaction1 that calls createValue using chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the transaction named transaction1 to create a commit listener called transaction1Listener
		When I use the transaction named transaction1 to submit a transaction with args []
		Then I receive 1 events from the listener transaction1Listener

	Scenario: Using a Contract I can listen to contract events emitted by instantiated chaincodes
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to listen for unfiltered create events with listener createValueListener on chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit 5 transactions with args [createValue] for chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		Then I receive 5 events from the listener createValueListener

	Scenario: Using a Contract I can listen to block events emitted by networks between a start and end block
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit a transaction with args [createValue] for chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to submit a transaction with args [createValue] for chaincode events instantiated on channel mychannel
		When I use the gateway named test_gateway to listen for unfiltered_block_events with listener unFilteredBlockListener between 0 and 3 on chaincode events01 instantiated on channel mychannel
		Then I receive 4 events from the listener unFilteredBlockListener
