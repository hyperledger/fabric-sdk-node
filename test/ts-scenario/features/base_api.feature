Feature: Use base API to perform core operations

Background:
    Given I place a scenario start message BASE API FEATURE
    Given I deploy a tls Fabric network at 2.0 version
    And I use the cli to create and join the channel named baseapichannel on the deployed network
    And I use the cli to deploy a node smart contract named fabcar at version 1.0.0 for all organizations on channel baseapichannel with endorsement policy 1of and arguments ["initLedger"]

Scenario: Using only fabric-base I can propose, endorse and commit a transaction on instantiated node chaincode
    Given I have created a client named leon based on information in profile ccp-tls under organization Org1
    And I have used the client named leon to create a channel object for the channel named baseapichannel
    When I build a new endorsement request named myFirstRequest for smart contract named fabcar with arguments [createCar, 2000, GMC, Savana, grey, Jones] as client leon on channel baseapichannel
    And I commit the endorsement request named myFirstRequest as client leon on channel baseapichannel
	Then the request named myFirstRequest for client leon has a general result matching {"result":"SUCCESS"}
	And the request named myFirstRequest for client leon has a event result matching {"result":"Commit success"}
	And the request named myFirstRequest for client leon has a commit result matching {"status":"SUCCESS"}

Scenario: Using only fabric-base I can send a query request to peers and recieve a valid result
    Given I have created a client named leon based on information in profile ccp-tls under organization Org1
    And I have used the client named leon to create a channel object for the channel named baseapichannel
    When I submit a query named myFirstQuery with args [queryCar,CAR0] for contract fabcar as client leon on channel baseapichannel
    Then the query named myFirstQuery for client leon has a general result matching {"result":"SUCCESS"}
	And the query named myFirstQuery for client leon has a peer0 result matching {"color":"blue","docType":"car","make":"Toyota","model":"Prius","owner":"Tomoko"}
