Feature: Use the Node SDK to install/instantiate/Upgrade chaincode with the deprecated API

	Background:
		Given I place a scenario start message DEPRECATED SDK FEATURE
		Given I deploy a tls Fabric network
		And I use the cli to create and join the channel named deprecatedchannel on the deployed network

 	Scenario: Using the deprecated API I can install and instantate a smart contract that may subsequently be used through a Gateway
		Given I use the deprecated sdk to deploy a node smart contract named fabcar at version 1.0.0 as fabcar for all organizations on channel deprecatedchannel with endorsement policy 1ofAny and arguments [initLedger] with the connection profile named ccp-tls.json
		And I have a memory backed gateway named myDeprecatedGateway with discovery set to false for user User1 using the connection profile named ccp-tls.json
		When I use the gateway named myDeprecatedGateway to submit a transaction with args [createCar,1001,Ariel,Atom,red,Nick] for contract fabcar instantiated on channel deprecatedchannel
		Then The gateway named myDeprecatedGateway has a submit type response
		When I use the gateway named myDeprecatedGateway to evaluate a transaction with args [queryCar,1001] for contract fabcar instantiated on channel deprecatedchannel
		Then The gateway named myDeprecatedGateway has a evaluate type response matching {"color":"red","docType":"car","make":"Ariel","model":"Atom","owner":"Nick"}
