The design allows recursion PolicySpec Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description type Object The type of policy can be \"signed-by\" for a single identity signature or \"n-of\" where \"n\" is a numeric value. If the type property is \"signed-by\", the value is the numeric index into the array of identities specified in the policy. If the type property is \"n-of\", the value is an array of PolicySpec objects. As you can see, this structure allows recursive definitions of complex policies. ProcessedTransaction Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description validationCode number See this list for all the defined validation codes transactionEnvelope Object Encapsulates the transaction and the signature over it. It has the following structure: signature -- {byte[]} payload -- {} header -- {Header} data -- {Transaction} ProposalRequest Type: Object Properties: Name Type Argument Description fcn string Required. The function name. args Array.&lt;string&gt; Required. Arguments to send to chaincode. chaincodeId string Required. ChaincodeId. argbytes Buffer Optional. Include when an argument must be included as bytes. transientMap object &lt;optional&gt; Optional. Object with String property names and Buffer property values that can be used by the chaincode but not saved in the ledger. Data such as cryptographic information for encryption can be passed to the chaincode using this technique. Data that is to be kept in a private data store (a collection) should be passed to the chaincode in the transientMap. ProposalResponse A protobuf message that gets returned by endorsing peers on proposal requests. The peer node runs the target chaincode, as designated by the proposal, and decides on whether to endorse the proposal or not, and sends back the endorsement result along with the read and write sets inside the proposal response message. Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description version number timestamp Timestamp Time the proposal was created by the submitter response Response payload Array.&lt;byte&gt; The payload of the response. It is the encoded bytes of the \"ProposalResponsePayload\" protobuf message endorsement Endorsement The endorsement of the proposal, basically the endorser's signature over the payload peer RemoteCharacteristics The characteristics of the peer that created this ProposalResponse. Items include the url, name, and connection options. This information is not returned from the peer, it is not part of the serialized protobuf data returned by the peer. This information is added by the client instance peer object to help identify this ProposalResponse object. ProposalResponseObject All calls to the endorsing peers for proposal endorsement return this standard array of objects. Type: array Properties: Name Type Description index:0 Array.&lt;(ProposalResponse|Error)&gt; Array where each element is either a ProposalResponse object (for a successful response from the endorsing peer) or an Error object (for an unsuccessful peer response or runtime error). index:1 Object The original Proposal object needed when sending the transaction request to the orderer RegisterRequest Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description enrollmentID string ID which will be used for enrollment enrollmentSecret string Optional enrollment secret to set for the registered user. If not provided, the server will generate one. role string Optional arbitrary string representing a role value for the user affiliation string Affiliation with which this user will be associated, like a company or an organization maxEnrollments number The maximum number of times this user will be permitted to enroll attrs Array.&lt;KeyValueAttribute&gt; Array of KeyValueAttribute attributes to assign to the user RegistrationOpts Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description startBlock integer Optional - The starting block number for event checking. When included, the peer's fabric service will be asked to start sending blocks from this block number. This is how to resume or replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. Default is the latest block on the ledger. Setting a startBlock may confuse other event listeners, therefore only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when a startBlock is being used. Setting a startBlock also requires this ChannelEventHub to connect to the fabric service using different options. The registration with a startBlock must be done before calling connect(). endBlock integer | 'newest' Optional - The ending block number for event checking. The value 'newest' indicates that the endBlock will be calculated by the peer as the newest block on the ledger at the time of registration. This allows the application to replay up to the latest block on the ledger and then the listener will stop and be notified by the 'onError' callback. When included, the peer's fabric service will be asked to stop sending blocks once this block is delivered. This is how to replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. When a startBlock is not included, the endBlock must be equal to or larger the current channel block height. Setting an endBlock may confuse other event listeners, therefore only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when an endBlock is being used. Setting a endBlock also requires this ChannelEventHub to connect to the fabric service using different options. The a registration with an endBlock must be done before calling connect(). unregister boolean Optional - This options setting indicates the registration should be removed (unregister) when the event is seen. When the application is using a timeout to only wait a specified amount of time for the transaction to be seen, the timeout processing should included the manual 'unregister' of the transaction event listener to avoid the event callbacks being called unexpectedly. The default for this setting is different for the different type of event listeners. For block listeners the default is true, however the event listener is assumed to have seen the final event only if the end_block was set as a option and that end_block was seen by the the listener. For transaction listeners the default is true and the listener will be unregistered when a transaction with the id is seen by this listener. For chaincode listeners the default will be false as the match filter might be intended for many transactions rather than a specific transaction or block as in the other listeners. If not set and the endBlock has been set, the listener will be automatically unregistered. disconnect boolean Optional - This option setting Indicates to the ChannelEventHub instance to automatically disconnect itself from the peer's fabric service once the event has been seen. The default is false. If not set and the endBlock has been set, the the ChannelEventHub instance will automatically disconnect itself. RemoteCharacteristics Information related to the peer instance object. Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description url string The url of this peer name string The name of this peer, this will be the host and port if the peer was not created with the name option. options Object The options object that this peer built based on defaults and what was passed when it was created. Typical options will include the GRPC connection settings. REQUEST_TIMEOUT The Error message string that indicates that the request operation has timed out due to a remote node issue. If there is an issue with the local system a 'SYSTEM_TIMEOUT' error message will be returned. The operation will only use one timer for both types of timeouts. The timer will start running as the operation begins. If the timer expires before the local instance is able to make the outbound request then 'SYSTEM_TIMEOUT' error will be returned. If the local instance is able to make the outbound request and the timer expires before the remote node responds then the 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT' is returned. The timer is controlled by the 'request-timeout' setting or passed on a call that makes an outbound request Type: Error Examples 'client.setConfigSetting('request-timeout', 3000)' 'channel.sendTranaction(request, 3000)' Response A response message indicating whether the endorsement of the proposal was successful Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description status number Status code.

Value can be \"member\" or \"admin\" mspId string The member service provider Id used to process the identity ServiceResponse Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description Success boolean Boolean indicating if the request was successful Result Object The result of this request Errors Array.&lt;ServiceResponseMessage&gt; An array of error messages (code and message) Messages Array.&lt;ServiceResponseMessage&gt; An array of information messages (code and message) ServiceResponseMessage Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description code number Integer code denoting the type of message message string A more specific message SignatureHeader An object that is part of all signatures in Hyperledger Fabric. The \"creator\" field has two important pieces of information about the identity of the signer, the organization (Mspid) that the signer belongs to, and the certificate (IdBytes). The \"nonce\" field is a unique value to guard against replay attacks. creator Mspid -- {string} IdBytes -- {byte[]} nonce -- {byte[]} Type: Object SignaturePolicy SignaturePolicy is a recursive message structure which defines a featherweight DSL for describing policies which are more complicated than 'exactly this signature'. The NOutOf operator is sufficent to express AND as well as OR, as well as of course N out of the following M policies. SignedBy implies that the signature is from a valid certificate which is signed by the trusted authority specified in the bytes. This will be the certificate itself for a self-signed certificate and will be the CA for more traditional certificates A \"SignaturePolicy\" will have the following object structure. type -- SIGNATURE rule Type -- n_out_of n_out_of N -- {int} rules -- {array} Type -- signed_by signed_by -- {int} identities -- {array} principal_classification -- {int} msp_identifier -- {string} Role -- MEMBER | ADMIN Type: Object SignedCommitProposal Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest Required.

The function name. signedProposal Buffer Required. The signed endorse proposal SYSTEM_TIMEOUT The Error message string that indicates that the request operation has timed out due to a system issue. This will indicate that the issue is local rather than remote. If there is an issue with the remote node a 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT' error message will be returned. The operation will only use one timer for both types of timeouts. The timer will start running as the operation begins. If the timer expires before the local instance is able to make the outbound request then 'SYSTEM_TIMEOUT' error will be returned. If the local instance is able to make the outbound request and the timer expires before the remote node responds then the 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT' is returned. The timer is controlled by the 'request-timeout' setting or passed on a call that makes an outbound request Type: Error Examples 'client.setConfigSetting('request-timeout', 3000)' 'channel.sendTranaction(request, 3000)' TLSOptions Type: Object Properties: Name Type Argument Default Description trustedRoots Array.&lt;string&gt; Array of PEM-encoded trusted root certificates verify boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Determines whether or not to verify the server certificate when using TLS Transaction A Transaction, or \"Endorser Transaction\", is the result of invoking chaincodes to collect endorsements, getting globally ordered in the context of a channel, and getting validated by the committer peer as part of a block before finally being formally \"committed\" to the ledger inside a Block. Each transaction contains an array of \"actions\" representing different steps for executing a transaction, and those steps will be processed atomically, meaning if any one step failed then the whole transaction will be marked as rejected. Each entry of the \"actions\" array contains a chaincode proposal and corresponding proposal responses that encapsulate the endorsing peer's decisions on whether the proposal is considered valid. Note that even if a transaction proposal(s) is considered valid by the endorsing peers, it may still be rejected by the committers during transaction validation. Whether a transaction as a whole is valid or not, is not reflected in the transaction record itself, but rather recorded in a separate field in the Block's metadata. A \"Transaction\" will have the following object structure. actions {array} header -- {SignatureHeader} payload chaincode_proposal_payload input -- {ChaincodeInvocationSpec} for a endorser transaction action proposal_response_payload proposal_hash -- {byte[]} extension results data_model -- {int} ns_rwset -- {array} namespace -- {string} rwset reads -- {array} key -- {string} version block_num -- {number} tx_num -- {number} range_queries_info -- {array} writes -- {array} key -- {string} is_delete -- {boolean} value -- {string} metadata_writes -- {array} key -- {string} entries -- {array} name -- {string} value -- {byte[]} collection_hashed_rwset -- {array} collection_name -- {string} hashed_rwset hashed_reads -- {array} key_hash -- {byte[]} version block_num -- {number} tx_num -- {number} hashed_writes -- {array} key_hash -- {byte[]} is_delete -- {boolean} value_hash -- {byte[]} metadata_writes -- {array} key_hash -- {byte[]} entries -- {array} name -- {string} value -- {byte[]} pvt_rwset_hash -- {byte[]} events chaincode_id -- {string} tx_id -- {string} event_name -- {string} payload -- {byte[]} response status -- {int} message -- {string} payload -- {byte[]} endorsements -- {Endorsement[]} Type: Object TransactionEventHandlerOptions Type: Object Properties: Name Type Argument Default Description commitTimeout Number &lt;optional&gt; 0 Number of seconds to wait for transaction completion.

The SDK is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime. Overview Hyperledger Fabric is the operating system of an enterprise-strength permissioned blockchain network. For a high-level overview of the fabric, visit http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Applications can be developed to interact with the blockchain network on behalf of the users. APIs are available to: create channels ask peer nodes to join the channel install chaincodes in peers instantiate chaincodes in a channel invoke transactions by calling the chaincode query the ledger for transactions or blocks How Different Components of the Fabric Work Together The Transaction Flow document provides an excellent description of the application/SDK, peers, and orderers working together to process transactions and producing blocks. Security on the Fabric is enforced with digital signatures. All requests made to the fabric must be signed by users with appropriate enrollment certificates. For a user's enrollment certificate to be considered valid on the Fabric, it must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Fabric supports any standard CAs. In addition, Fabric provides a CA server. See this overview. Features of the SDK for Node.js The Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js is designed in an Object-Oriented programming style. Its modular construction enables application developers to plug in alternative implementations of key functions such as crypto suites, the state persistence store, and logging utility. The SDK's list of features include: fabric-network (the recommended API for): Submitting transactions to a smart contract. Querying a smart contract for the latest application state. fabric-client: create a new channel send channel information to a peer to join install chaincode on a peer instantiate chaincode in a channel, which involves two steps: propose and transact submitting a transaction, which also involves two steps: propose and transact query a chaincode for the latest application state various query capabilities: channel height block-by-number, block-by-hash all channels that a peer is part of all installed chaincodes in a peer all instantiated chaincodes in a channel transaction-by-id channel configuration data monitoring events: connect to a peer's event stream listen on block events listen on transactions events and find out if the transaction was successfully committed to the ledger or marked invalid listen on custom events produced by chaincodes serializable User object with signing capabilities hierarchical configuration settings with multiple layers of overrides: files, environment variable, program arguments, in-memory settings logging utility with a built-in logger (winston) and can be overriden with a number of popular loggers including log4js and bunyan pluggable CryptoSuite interface describe the cryptographic operations required for successful interactions with the Fabric. Two implementations are provided out of box: Software-based ECDSA PKCS#11-compliant ECDSA pluggable State Store interface for persisting state caches such as users File-based store CouchDB-base store which works with both CouchDB database and IBM Cloudant customizable Crypto Key Store for any software-based cryptographic suite implementation supports both TLS (grpcs://) or non-TLS (grpc://) connections to peers and orderers, see Remote which is the superclass for peers and orderers fabric-ca-client: register a new user enroll a user to obtain the enrollment certificate signed by the Fabric CA revoke an existing user by enrollment ID or revoke a specific certificate customizable persistence store API Reference The SDK is made up of 4 top-level modules that can be accessed through the navigation menu Modules: fabric-network: Provides high level APIs for client applications to submit transactions and evaluate queries for a smart contract (chaincode). api: Pluggable APIs for application developers to supply alternative implementations of key interfaces used by the SDK. For each interface there are built-in default implementations. fabric-client: Provides APIs to interact with the core components of a Hypreledger Fabric-based blockchain network, namely the peers, orderers and event streams. fabric-ca-client: Provides APIs to interact with the optional component, fabric-ca, that contains services for membership management.

It also contains utility methods for constructing new instances of CryptoKeyStore, CryptoSuite and KeyValueStore new BaseClient() Methods &lt;static&gt; addConfigFile(path) Adds a file to the top of the list of configuration setting files that are part of the hierarchical configuration. These files will override the default settings and be overriden by environment, command line arguments, and settings programmatically set into configuration settings. The hierarchical configuration settings search order: see BaseClient.getConfigSetting Parameters: Name Type Description path String The path to the file to be added to the top of list of configuration files &lt;static&gt; getConfigSetting(name, default_value) Retrieves a setting from the hierarchical configuration and if not found will return the provided default value. The hierarchical configuration settings search order for a setting aa-bb: memory: if the setting has been added with Client.setConfigSetting('aa-bb', 'value') Command-line arguments: like node app.js --aa-bb value Environment variables: AA_BB=value node app.js Custom Files: all files added with addConfigFile(path) will be ordered by when added, where same settings in the files added later will override those added earlier The file located at lib/config/default.json with default settings Parameters: Name Type Description name String The name of a setting default_value Object The value of a setting if not found in the hierarchical configuration &lt;static&gt; getLogger(name) Use this method to get a logger that will add entries to the same location being used by the Hyperledger Fabric client. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the label to be added to the log entries. To help identify the source of the log entry. Returns: The logger that may be used to log entires with 'info()', 'warn()', 'error()' and 'debug()' methods to mark the the type of the log entries. Type Logger &lt;static&gt; newCryptoKeyStore(KVSImplClass, opts) This is a factory method. It returns a new instance of the CryptoKeyStore. When the application needs to use a key store other than the default, it should create a new CryptoKeyStore and set it on the CryptoSuite. cryptosuite.setCryptoKeyStore(Client.newCryptoKeyStore(KVSImplClass, opts)) Parameters: Name Type Description KVSImplClass api.KeyValueStore Optional. The built-in key store saves private keys. The key store may be backed by different KeyValueStore implementations. If specified, the value of the argument must point to a module implementing the KeyValueStore interface. opts Object Implementation-specific option object used in the constructor Returns: a new instance of the CryptoKeystore Type CryptoKeyStore &lt;static&gt; newCryptoSuite(setting) This is a factory method. It returns a new instance of the CryptoSuite API implementation, based on the \"setting\" that is passed in, or if skipped, based on default values of the CryptoSetting properties. Parameters: Name Type Description setting CryptoSetting Optional Returns: a new instance of the CryptoSuite API implementation Type module:api.CryptoSuite &lt;static&gt; newDefaultKeyValueStore(options) Obtains an instance of the KeyValueStore class. By default it returns the built-in implementation, which is based on files (FileKeyValueStore). This can be overriden with a configuration setting key-value-store, the value of which is the full path of a CommonJS module for the alternative implementation. Parameters: Name Type Description options Object Specific to the implementation, for initializing the instance. For the built-in file-based implementation, this requires a single property path to the top-level folder for the store Returns: A Promise for a module:api.KeyValueStore instance of the KeyValueStore implementation Type Promise &lt;static&gt; normalizeX509(raw) Fixes a certificate string that may not be in the correct format. Make sure there's a start line with '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----' and end line with '-----END CERTIFICATE-----', so as to be compliant with x509 parsers. Will remove or add required linefeeds and carriage returns. Parameters: Name Type Description raw string a string that contains a X509 certificate Throws: An error indicating that the begining and end parts are not correct. Type Error &lt;static&gt; setConfigSetting(name, value) Adds a setting to override all settings that are part of the hierarchical configuration. The hierarchical configuration settings search order: see BaseClient.getConfigSetting Parameters: Name Type Description name String The name of a setting value Object The value of a setting &lt;static&gt; setLogger(logger) Configures a logger for the entire SDK to use and override the default logger. Unless this method is called, the SDK uses a default logger based on winston. When using the built-in winston based logger, use the configuration setting hfc-logging to pass in configurations in the following format: { 'error': 'error.log', // 'error' logs are printed to file 'error.log' relative of the current working dir for node.js 'debug': '/tmp/myapp/debug.log', // 'debug' and anything more critical ('info', 'warn', 'error') can also be an absolute path 'info': 'console' // 'console' is a keyword for logging to console } Parameters: Name Type Description logger Object a logger instance that defines the following methods: debug(), info(), warn(), error() with string interpolation methods like util.format. getCryptoSuite() Returns the CryptoSuite object used by this client instance Returns: Type module:api.CryptoSuite setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite) Sets the client instance to use the CryptoSuite object for signing and hashing Creating and setting a CryptoSuite is optional because the client will construct an instance based on default configuration settings: crypto-hsm: use an implementation for Hardware Security Module (if set to true) or software-based key management (if set to false) crypto-keysize: security level, or key size, to use with the digital signature public key algorithm. Currently ECDSA is supported and the valid key sizes are 256 and 384 crypto-hash-algo: hashing algorithm key-value-store: some CryptoSuite implementation requires a key store to persist private keys. A CryptoKeyStore is provided for this purpose, which can be used on top of any implementation of the KeyValueStore interface, such as a file-based store or a database-based one.

A Channel object captures the settings needed to interact with a fabric backend in the context of a channel. These settings including the list of participating organizations, represented by instances of Membership Service Providers (MSP), the list of endorsing peers, and an orderer. A client application can use the Channel object to create new channels with the orderer, update an existing channel, send various channel-aware requests to the peers such as invoking chaincodes to process transactions or queries. A Channel object is also responsible for verifying endorsement signatures in transaction proposal responses. A channel object must be initialized after it has been configured with the list of peers and orderers. The initialization sends a get configuration block request to the primary orderer to retrieve the configuration settings for this channel. new Channel(name, clientContext) Returns a new instance of the class. This is a client-side-only call. To create a new channel in the fabric, call createChannel(). Parameters: Name Type Description name string Name to identify the channel. This value is used as the identifier of the channel when making channel-aware requests with the fabric, such as invoking chaincodes to endorse transactions. The naming of channels is enforced by the ordering service and must be unique within the fabric backend. Channel name in fabric network is subject to a pattern revealed in the configuration setting channel-name-regx-checker. clientContext Client The client instance, which provides operational context such as the signing identity Methods &lt;async, static&gt; sendSignedProposal(request, timeout) Send signed transaction proposal to peer Parameters: Name Type Description request SignedProposal signed endorse transaction proposal, this signed proposal would be send to peer directly. timeout number the timeout setting passed on sendSignedProposal &lt;async&gt; _discover(request) Send a request to a known peer to discover information about the fabric network. Parameters: Name Type Description request DiscoveryRequest - Returns: The results from the discovery service Type DiscoveryResponse addOrderer(orderer, replace) Add the orderer object to the channel object, this is a client-side-only operation. An application may add more than one orderer object to the channel object, however the SDK only uses the first one in the list to send broadcast messages to the orderer backend. Parameters: Name Type Description orderer Orderer An instance of the Orderer class. replace boolean If an orderer exist with the same name, replace with this one. addPeer(peer, mspid, roles, replace) Add the peer object to the channel object. A channel object can be optionally configured with a list of peer objects, which will be used when calling certain methods such as sendInstantiateProposal(), sendUpgradeProposal(), sendTransactionProposal. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer An instance of the Peer class that has been initialized with URL and other gRPC options such as TLS credentials and request timeout. mspid string The mpsid of the organization this peer belongs. roles ChannelPeerRoles Optional. The roles this peer will perform on this channel. A role that is not defined will default to true replace boolean If a peer exist with the same name, replace with this one. close() Close the service connections of all assigned peers and orderers compareProposalResponseResults(The) Utility method to examine a set of proposals to check they contain the same endorsement result write sets. This will validate that the endorsing peers all agree on the result of the chaincode execution. Parameters: Name Type Description The Array.&lt;ProposalResponse&gt; proposal responses from all endorsing peers Returns: True when all proposals compare equally, false otherwise. Type boolean generateUnsignedProposal(request, mspId, certificate, admin) Generates the endorse proposal bytes for a transaction Current the sendTransactionProposal sign a transaction using the user identity from SDK's context (which contains the user's private key). This method is designed to build the proposal bytes at SDK side, and user can sign this proposal with their private key, and send the signed proposal to peer by [sendSignedProposal] so the user's private key would not be required at SDK side. Parameters: Name Type Description request ProposalRequest chaincode invoke request mspId string the mspId for this identity certificate string PEM encoded certificate admin boolean if this transaction is invoked by admin Returns: Type Proposal generateUnsignedTransaction(request) generate the commit proposal for a transaction Parameters: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest getChannelCapabilities(configEnvelope) This utility method takes a ConfigEnvelope as queried from a channel and locates the channel's capabilities Parameters: Name Type Description configEnvelope ConfigEnvelope The grpc ConfigEnvelope as returned from the getChannelConfig() method.

Parameters: Name Type Description target string | Peer Optional. The peer to be used to make the request. timeout Number Optional. A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance(s) and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for a ConfigEnvelope object containing the configuration items. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; getChannelConfigFromOrderer() Asks the orderer for the current (latest) configuration block for this channel. This is similar to getGenesisBlock(), except that instead of getting block number 0 it gets the latest block that contains the channel configuration, and only returns the decoded ConfigEnvelope. Returns: A Promise for a ConfigEnvelope object containing the configuration items. Type Promise getChannelEventHub(name) Returns a ChannelEventHub object. An event hub object encapsulates the properties of an event stream on a peer node, through which the peer publishes notifications of blocks being committed in the channel's ledger. This method will create a new ChannelEventHub if one does not exist. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The peer name associated with this channel event hub. Use the Peer#getName method to get the name of a peer instance that has been added to this channel. Returns: - The ChannelEventHub associated with the peer. Type ChannelEventHub getChannelEventHubsForOrg(mspid) Returns a list of ChannelEventHub based on the peers that are defined in this channel that are in the organization. Parameters: Name Type Description mspid string Optional - The mspid of an organization Returns: An array of ChannelEventHub instances Type Array.&lt;ChannelEventHub&gt; getChannelPeer(name) See in getPeer Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the peer Returns: The ChannelPeer instance Type ChannelPeer getChannelPeers() See in getPeers Returns: The channel peer list on the channel.

Parameters: Name Type Description mspid string Optional - The name of an organization Returns: An array of Peer instances Type Array.&lt;Peer&gt; &lt;async&gt; initialize(request) Initializes the channel object with the Membership Service Providers (MSPs). The channel's MSPs are critical in providing applications the ability to validate certificates and verify signatures in messages received from the fabric backend. For instance, after calling sendTransactionProposal(), the application can verify the signatures in the proposal response's endorsements to ensure they have not been tampered with. This method retrieves the configuration from the orderer if no \"config\" parameter is passed in. Optionally a configuration may be passed in to initialize this channel without making the call to the orderer. This method will also automatically load orderers and peers that represent the fabric network when using discovery. This application must provide a peer running the fabric discovery service. Parameters: Name Type Description request InitializeRequest Optional. a InitializeRequest Returns: A Promise that will resolve when the action is complete Type Promise joinChannel(request, timeout) For a peer node to become part of a channel, it must be sent the genesis block, as explained here.

This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance(s) and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for an array of ProposalResponse from the target peers Type Promise newChannelEventHub(peer) Returns a ChannelEventHub object. An event hub object encapsulates the properties of an event stream on a peer node, through which the peer publishes notifications of blocks being committed in the channel's ledger. This method will create a new ChannelEventHub and not save a reference. Use the {getChannelEventHub} to reuse a ChannelEventHub. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer | string Optional. A Peer instance or the name of a peer that has been assigned to the channel. If not provided the ChannelEventHub must be connected with a \"target\" peer.

Type Promise &lt;async&gt; queryByChaincode(request, useAdmin) Sends a proposal to one or more endorsing peers that will be handled by the chaincode. There is no difference in how the endorsing peers process a request to invoke a chaincode for transaction vs. to invoke a chaincode for query. All requests will be presented to the target chaincode's 'Invoke' method which must be implemented to understand from the arguments that this is a query request. The chaincode must also return results in the byte array format and the caller will have to be able to decode these results. If the request contains a txId property, that transaction ID will be used, and its administrative privileges will apply. In this case the useAdmin parameter to this function will be ignored. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeQueryRequest useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call. Ignored if the request contains a txId property. Returns: A Promise for an array of byte array results returned from the chaincode on all Endorsing Peers Type Promise Example Get the list of query results returned by the chaincode const responsePayloads = await channel.queryByChaincode(request); for (let i = 0; i &lt; responsePayloads.length; i++) { console.log(util.format('Query result from peer [%s]: %s', i, responsePayloads[i].toString('utf8'))); } &lt;async&gt; queryCollectionsConfig(options, useAdmin) Query for the collection definitions associated with a chaincode.

Returns: A Promise for a fully decoded ProcessedTransaction object. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; refresh() Refresh the channel's configuration. The MSP configurations, peers, orderers, and endorsement plans will be queired from the peer using the Discover Service. The queries will be made to the peer used previously for discovery if the 'target' parameter is not provided. Returns: - The results of refreshing Type DiscoveryResults removeOrderer(orderer) Remove the first orderer object in the channel object's list of orderers whose endpoint url property matches the url of the orderer that is passed in. Parameters: Name Type Description orderer Orderer An instance of the Orderer class. removePeer(peer) Remove the peer object in the channel object's list of peers whose endpoint url property matches the url or name of the peer that is passed in. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer An instance of the Peer class. sendInstantiateProposal(request, timeout) Sends a chaincode instantiate proposal to one or more endorsing peers. A chaincode must be instantiated on a channel-by-channel basis before it can be used. The chaincode must first be installed on the endorsing peers where this chaincode is expected to run, by calling client.installChaincode(). Instantiating a chaincode is a full transaction operation, meaning it must be first endorsed as a proposal, then the endorsements are sent to the orderer to be processed for ordering and validation. When the transaction finally gets committed to the channel's ledger on the peers, the chaincode is then considered activated and the peers are ready to take requests to process transactions. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise &lt;async&gt; sendSignedProposal(request, timeout) Send signed transaction proposal to peer Parameters: Name Type Description request SignedProposal signed endorse transaction proposal, this signed proposal would be send to peer directly. timeout number the timeout setting passed on sendSignedProposal &lt;async&gt; sendSignedTransaction(request, timeout) send the signed commit proposal for a transaction Parameters: Name Type Description request SignedCommitProposal the signed commit proposal timeout number the timeout setting passed on sendSignedProposal &lt;async&gt; sendTransaction(request, timeout) Send the proposal responses that contain the endorsements of a transaction proposal to the orderer for further processing. This is the 2nd phase of the transaction lifecycle in the fabric. The orderer will globally order the transactions in the context of this channel and deliver the resulting blocks to the committing peers for validation against the chaincode's endorsement policy. When the committing peers successfully validate the transactions, it will mark the transaction as valid inside the block. After all transactions in a block have been validated, and marked either as valid or invalid (with a reason code), the block will be appended (committed) to the channel's ledger on the peer. The caller of this method must use the proposal responses returned from the endorser along with the original proposal that was sent to the endorser. Both of these objects are contained in the ProposalResponseObject returned by calls to any of the following methods: sendInstantiateProposal() sendUpgradeProposal() sendTransactionProposal() Parameters: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest TransactionRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Orderer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for a \"BroadcastResponse\" message returned by the orderer that contains a single \"status\" field for a standard HTTP response code. This will be an acknowledgement from the orderer of a successfully submitted transaction. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; sendTransactionProposal(request, timeout) Sends a transaction proposal to one or more endorsing peers. After a chaincode gets installed and instantiated, it's ready to take endorsement proposals and participating in transaction processing. A chaincode transaction starts with a proposal that gets sent to the endorsing peers, which executes the target chaincode and decides whether the proposal should be endorsed (if it executes successfully) or not (if the chaincode returns an error). Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInvokeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise sendUpgradeProposal(request, timeout) Sends a chaincode upgrade proposal to one or more endorsing peers. Upgrading a chaincode involves steps similar to instantiating a chaincode. The new chaincode must first be installed on the endorsing peers where this chaincode is expected to run. Similar to instantiating a chaincode, upgrading chaincodes is also a full transaction operation. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise setMSPManager(msp_manager) Set the MSP Manager for this channel. This utility method will not normally be use as the initialize() method will read this channel's current configuration and reset MSPManager with the MSP's found in the channel configuration. Parameters: Name Type Description msp_manager MSPManager The msp manager for this channel toString() return a printable representation of this channel object verifyProposalResponse(proposal_response) Utility method to verify a single proposal response. It checks the following aspects: The endorser's identity belongs to a legitimate MSP of the channel and can be successfully deserialized The endorsement signature can be successfully verified with the endorser's identity certificate This method requires that the initialize method of this channel object has been called to load this channel's MSPs. The MSPs will have the trusted root certificates for this channel. Parameters: Name Type Description proposal_response ProposalResponse The endorsement response from the peer, includes the endorser certificate and signature over the proposal + endorsement result + endorser certificate. Returns: A boolean value of true when both the identity and the signature are valid, false otherwise.

Returns: An instance of this class Type ChannelEventHub Methods checkConnection(force_reconnect) Returns if the stream is ready. and will attempt a restart when forced Parameters: Name Type Description force_reconnect boolean attempt to reconnect if the stream is not in the 'READY' state close() Disconnects the ChannelEventHub from the fabric peer service. Will close all event listeners and send an EventHubDisconnectError object with the message \"ChannelEventHub has been shutdown\" to all listeners that provided an \"onError\" callback. connect(options, connectCallback) Establishes a connection with the fabric peer service. The connection will be established asynchronously. If the connection fails to get established, the application will be notified via the 'connectCallback' provided. Additionally the error callbacks from the registerXXXEvent() methods will be notified if provided. It is recommended that an application relay on 'connectCallback' to determine connect status and relay on the 'errCallback' of the event listeners for runtime connection issues. Register event listeners and the error callbacks by calling any one of the registerBlockEvent, registerTxEvent or registerChaincodeEvent methods, after calling connect(). Parameters: Name Type Description options ConnectOptions | boolean Optional. If of type boolean then it will be assumed to how to connect to receive full (true) or filtered (false) blocks. connectCallback function Optional. This callback will report completion of the connection to the peer or will report any errors encountered during connection to the peer. When there is an error, this ChannelEventHub will be shutdown (disconnected). Callback function should take two parameters as (error, value). disconnect() Disconnects the ChannelEventHub from the peer event source. Will close all event listeners and send an EventHubDisconnectError object with the message \"ChannelEventHub has been shutdown\" to all listeners that provided an \"onError\" callback. generateUnsignedRegistration(options) Generate the unsigned fabric service registration, this should be signed by the identity's private key. Parameters: Name Type Description options EventHubRegistrationRequest the options for register this ChannelEventHub with the fabric peer service.

Parameters: Name Type Description options ConnectOptions Optional. connectCallback function Optional. This callback will report completion of the connection to the peer or will report any errors encountered during connection to the peer. When there is an error, this ChannelEventHub will be shutdown (disconnected). Callback function should take two parameters as (error, value). registerBlockEvent(onEvent, onError, options) Register a listener to receive all block committed to this channel. The listener's \"onEvent\" callback gets called on the arrival of every block. An error may occur in the connection establishment which runs asynchronously. The best practice would be to provide an \"onError\" callback to be notified when this ChannelEventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description onEvent function Callback function that takes a single parameter of a Block object onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this ChannelEventHub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network or connection error, by a call to the \"disconnect()\" method or when the fabric service ends the connection this ChannelEventHub. This callback will also be called when the ChannelEventHub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying and requesting the endBlock to be 'newest'. options RegistrationOpts Options on the registrations to allow for start and end block numbers, automatically unregister and automatically disconnect. Returns: This is the block registration number that must be used to unregister this block listener. see unregisterBlockEvent() Type int registerChaincodeEvent(chaincode_id, event_name, onEvent, onError, options) Register a listener to receive chaincode events. An error may occur in the connection establishment which runs asynchronously. The best practice would be to provide an \"onError\" callback to be notified when this ChannelEventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description chaincode_id string Id of the chaincode of interest event_name string | RegExp The exact name of the chaincode event or regular expression that will be matched against the name given to the target chaincode's call stub.SetEvent(name, payload)) onEvent function callback function for matched events.

The shutdown may be caused by a network or connection error, by a call to the \"disconnect()\" method or when the fabric service ends the connection this ChannelEventHub. This callback will also be called when the ChannelEventHub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying and requesting the endBlock to be 'newest'. options RegistrationOpts Options on the registrations to allow for start and end block numbers, automatically unregister and automatically disconnect. Chaincode event listeners may also use the \"as_array\" option to indicate that all the chaincode events found that match this definition be sent to the callback as an array or call the callback for each one individually. Returns: An object that should be treated as an opaque handle used to unregister (see unregisterChaincodeEvent()) Type Object Example Chaincode callback to process events when as_array:true function myCallback(...events) { for ({chaincode_event, block_num, tx_id, tx_status} of events) { // process the chaincode event } } registerTxEvent(txid, onEvent, onError, options) Register a callback function to receive a notification when the transaction by the given id has been committed into a block. Using the special string 'all' will indicate that this listener will notify (call) the callback for every transaction received from the fabric service. An error may occur in the connection establishment which runs asynchronously. The best practice would be to provide an \"onError\" callback to be notified when this ChannelEventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description txid string Transaction id string or 'all' onEvent function Callback function that takes a parameter of transaction ID, a string parameter indicating the transaction status, and the block number of this transaction committed to the ledger onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this ChannelEventHub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network or connection error, by a call to the \"disconnect()\" method or when the fabric event service ends the connection this ChannelEventHub. This callback will also be called when the ChannelEventHub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying and requesting the endBlock to be 'newest'. options RegistrationOpts Options on the registrations to allow for start and end block numbers, automatically unregister and automatically disconnect. Returns: The transaction ID that was used to register this event listener. May be used to unregister this event listener. Type string unregisterBlockEvent(block_registration_number, throwError) Unregister the block event listener using the block registration number that is returned by the call to the registerBlockEvent() method. Parameters: Name Type Description block_registration_number int The block registration number that was returned during registration. throwError boolean Optional - throw an error if the block registration does not exist, default is to not throw an error unregisterChaincodeEvent(listener_handle, throwError) Unregister the chaincode event listener represented by the listener_handle object returned by the registerChaincodeEvent() method Parameters: Name Type Description listener_handle Object The handle object returned from the call to registerChaincodeEvent. throwError boolean Optional - throw an error if the chaincode event registration does not exist, default is to not throw an error unregisterTxEvent(txid, throwError) Unregister transaction event listener for the transaction id.

An application using the SDK may need to interact with multiple networks, each through a separate instance of the Client. An important aspect of the current design of the Client class is that it is stateful. An instance must be configured with a userContext before it can be used to talk to the fabric backend. A userContext is an instance of the User class, which encapsulates the ability to sign requests. If the SDK is used in a multi-user environment, there are two recommended techniques to manage the authenticated users and instances of clients. Use a dedicated client instance per authenticated user. Create a new instance for each authenticated user. You can enroll each authenticated user separately so that each user gets its own signing identity. Use a shared client instance and a common signing identity among authenticated users. It is important to understand that switching userContexts with the same client instance is considered an anti-pattern. This is the direct result of the stateful design. A JIRA work item has been opened to discuss adding support for stateless usage of the SDK: FAB-4563 The client also supports persistence via a stateStore. A state store is a simple storage plugin that implements the module:api.KeyValueStore interface, which helps the SDK save critical information to be used across server restarts/crashes. Out of the box, the SDK saves the signing identities (instances of the User class) in the state store. new Client() Extends BaseClient Methods &lt;static&gt; loadFromConfig(loadConfig) Load a common connection profile object or load a JSON file and return a Client object. Parameters: Name Type Description loadConfig object | string This may be the config object or a path to the configuration file Returns: An instance of this class initialized with the network end points. Type Client &lt;async&gt; _setUserFromConfig(opts) Utility Method Sets the user context based on the passed in username and password and the organization in the client section of the common connection profile settings. Parameters: Name Type Description opts Object contains - username [required] - username of the user - password [optional] - password of the user - caName [optional] - name of the Certificate Authority addConnectionOptions(options) Add a set of connection options to this client. These will be available to be merged into an application's options when new peers and orderers are created or when a channel uses discovery to automatically create the peers and orderers on the channel. This would be a convenient place to store common GRPC settings that affect all connections from this client. These settings will be used when this client object builds new Peer or Orderer instances when the Client#newPeer, Client#getPeer, Client#newOrderer or Client#getOrderer methods are called. Options will be automatically added when loading a common connection profile and the client section has the 'connection' section with an 'options' attribute. Default connection options will be initially loaded from the system configuration 'connection-options' setting. Parameters: Name Type Description options object The connection options that will be added to this client instance. addTlsClientCertAndKey(opts) Utility method to add the mutual tls client material to a set of options. Parameters: Name Type Description opts object The options object holding the connection settings that will be updated with the mutual TLS clientCert and clientKey. Throws: Will throw an error if generating the tls client material fails buildConnectionOptions(options) Utility method to merge connection options into a set of options and return a new options object. The client's options and default connection options will not override any passed settings by the same name, these will only be added as new settings to the application's options being passed in. see Client#addConnectionOptions for how this client will have connection options to merge. Parameters: Name Type Description options object The object holding the application options that will be merged on top of this client's options. Returns: - The object holding both the application's options and this client's options. Type object createChannel(request) Calls the orderer to start building the new channel. A channel typically has more than one participating organizations. To create a new channel, one of the participating organizations should call this method to submit the creation request to the orderer service. Once the channel is successfully created by the orderer, the next step is to have each organization's peer nodes join the channel, by sending the channel configuration to each of the peer nodes. The step is accomplished by calling the joinChannel() method. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChannelRequest The request object. Returns: Promise for a result object with status on the acceptance of the create request by the orderer. Note that this is not the confirmation of successful creation of the channel. The client application must poll the orderer to discover whether the channel has been created completely or not. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; createUser(opts) Returns a User object with signing identities based on the private key and the corresponding x509 certificate. This allows applications to use pre-existing crypto materials (private keys and certificates) to construct user objects with signing capabilities, as an alternative to dynamically enrolling users with fabric-ca Note that upon successful creation of the new user object, it is set to the client instance as the current userContext. Parameters: Name Type Description opts UserOpts Essential information about the user Returns: Promise for the user object. Type Promise extractChannelConfig(config_envelope) Extracts the protobuf 'ConfigUpdate' object out of the 'ConfigEnvelope' object that is produced by the configtxgen tool. The returned object may then be signed using the signChannelConfig() method of this class. Once the all signatures have been collected, the 'ConfigUpdate' object and the signatures may be used on the createChannel() or updateChannel() calls. Parameters: Name Type Description config_envelope Array.&lt;byte&gt; The encoded bytes of the ConfigEnvelope protobuf Returns: The encoded bytes of the ConfigUpdate protobuf, ready to be signed Type Array.&lt;byte&gt; getCertificateAuthority(name) Returns a CertificateAuthority implementation as defined by the settings in the currently loaded common connection profile and the client configuration. A common connection profile must be loaded for this get method to return a Certificate Authority. A crypto suite must be assigned to this client instance. Running the 'initCredentialStores' method will build the stores and create a crypto suite as defined in the common connection profile. Parameters: Name Type Description name string Optional - the name of the Certificate Authority defined in the loaded connection profile. Returns: Type CertificateAuthority getChannel(name, throwError) Get a Channel instance from the client instance. This is a memory-only lookup. If the loaded common connection profile has a channel by the 'name', a new channel instance will be created and populated with Orderer objects and Peer objects as defined in the common connection profile. Parameters: Name Type Default Description name string Optional. The name of the channel. When omitted the first channel defined in the loaded common connection profile will be returned throwError boolean true Indicates if this method will throw an error if the channel is not found. Default is true. Returns: The channel instance Type Channel getClientCertHash(create) Get the client certificate hash Parameters: Name Type Description create boolean Optional. Create the hash based on the current user if the client cert has not been assigned to this client Returns: The hash of the client certificate Type Array.&lt;byte&gt; getClientConfig() Returns the \"client\" section of the common connection profile. Returns: The client section from the configuration Type object getCryptoSuite() Returns the CryptoSuite object used by this client instance Inherited From: BaseClient#getCryptoSuite Overrides: BaseClient#getCryptoSuite Returns: Type module:api.CryptoSuite getMspid() Returns the mspid of the client. The mspid is also used as the reference to the organization. Returns: the mspid of the organization defined in the client section of the loaded common connection profile Type string getOrderer(name) This method will create the Orderer if it does not exist and hold a reference to the instance object by name. This method is only able to create an instance of an orderer if there is a loaded connection profile that contains an orderer with the name. Orderers that have been created by the newOrderer method may be reference by the url if no name was provided in the options. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name or url of the orderer Returns: The Orderer instance. Type Orderer getPeer(name) This method will create a Peer instance. This method is only able to create an instance of a peer if there is a loaded connection profile that contains a peer with the name. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the peer Returns: The Peer instance. Type Peer getPeersForOrg(mspid) Returns a list of Peer for the mspid of an organization as defined in the currently loaded common connection profile. If no id is provided then the organization named in the currently active network configuration's client section will be used. Parameters: Name Type Description mspid string Optional - The mspid of an organization Returns: An array of Peer instances that are defined for this organization Type Array.&lt;Peer&gt; getStateStore() A convenience method for obtaining the state store object in use by this client. Returns: The KeyValueStore implementation object set on this Client, or null if one has not been set. Type module:api.KeyValueStore &lt;async&gt; getUserContext(name, checkPersistence) Returns the user by the given name. This can be a synchronous call or asynchronous call, depending on whether \"checkPersistent\" is truthy or not. If truthy, the method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, otherwise it's synchronous. As explained above, the client instance can have an optional state store. The SDK saves enrolled users in the storage which can be accessed by authorized users of the application (authentication is done by the application outside of the SDK). This function attempts to load the user by name from the local storage (via the KeyValueStore interface). The loaded user object must represent an enrolled user with a valid enrollment certificate signed by a trusted CA (such as the CA server). Parameters: Name Type Description name string Optional. If not specified, will only return the current in-memory user context object, or null if none has been set. If \"name\" is specified, will also attempt to load it from the state store if search in memory failed. checkPersistence boolean Optional. If specified and truthy, the method returns a Promise and will attempt to check the state store for the requested user by the \"name\". If not specified or falsey, the method is synchronous and returns the requested user from memory Returns: Promise for the user object corresponding to the name, or null if the user does not exist or if the state store has not been set. Type Promise.&lt;User&gt; &lt;async&gt; initCredentialStores() Sets the state and crypto suite for use by this client. This requires that a common connection profile has been loaded. Will use the settings from the common connection profile along with the system configuration to build instances of the stores and assign them to this client and the crypto suites if needed. Returns: - A promise to build a key value store and crypto store. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; installChaincode(request, timeout) A chaincode must be installed to peers and instantiated on a channel before it can be called to process transactions. Chaincode installation is simply uploading the chaincode source and dependencies to the peers. This operation is \"channel-agnostic\" and is performed on a peer-by-peer basis. Only the peer organization's ADMIN identities are allowed to perform this operation. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstallRequest The request object timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for a ProposalResponseObject Type Promise isDevMode() Determine if the fabric backend is started in development mode. In development mode, the endorsing peers will not attempt to spin up a docker instance to run the target chaincode requested by a transaction proposal, but instead redirect the invocation requests to the chaincode process that has registered itself with the endorsing peer. This makes it easier to test changes to the chaincode during chaincode development. The client instance can be set to dev mode to reflect the backend's development mode. This will cause the SDK to make adjustments in certain behaviors such as not sending the chaincode package to the peers during chaincode install. loadFromConfig(config) Load a common connection profile object or load a JSON file and update this client with any values in the config. Parameters: Name Type Description config object | string This may be the config object or a path to the configuration file &lt;async&gt; loadUserFromStateStore(name) Restore the state of the User by the given name from the key value store (if found). If not found, return null. Parameters: Name Type Description name string Name of the user Returns: A Promise for a {User} object upon successful restore, or if the user by the name does not exist in the state store, returns null without rejecting the promise Type Promise newChannel(name) Returns a Channel instance with the given name. This represents a channel and its associated ledger. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the channel. Recommend using namespaces to avoid collision. Returns: The uninitialized channel instance. Type Channel newOrderer(url, opts) Returns an Orderer object with the given url and opts. An orderer object encapsulates the properties of an orderer node and the interactions with it via the grpc stream API. Orderer objects are used by the Client objects to broadcast requests for creating and updating channels. They are used by the Channel objects to broadcast requests for ordering transactions. This method will create the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of \"grpc(s)://host:port\". opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the orderer. Returns: The Orderer instance. Type Orderer newPeer(url, opts) Returns a Peer object with the given url and opts. A peer object encapsulates the properties of an endorsing peer and the interactions with it via the grpc service API. Peer objects are used by the Client objects to send channel-agnostic requests such as installing chaincode, querying peers for installed chaincodes, etc. They are also used by the Channel objects to send channel-aware requests such as instantiating chaincodes, and invoking transactions. This method will return a new Peer object. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of \"grpc(s)://host:port\". opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the peer. Returns: The Peer instance. Type Peer newTransactionID(admin) Returns a new TransactionID object. Fabric transaction ids are constructed as a hash of a nonce concatenated with the signing identity's serialized bytes. The TransactionID object keeps the nonce and the resulting id string bundled together as a coherent pair. This method requires the client instance to have been assigned a userContext. Parameters: Name Type Description admin boolean If true, this transactionID should be built based on the admin credentials Default is a non admin TransactionID based on the userContext. Returns: An object that contains a transaction id based on the client's userContext and a randomly generated nonce value. Type TransactionID &lt;async&gt; queryChannels(peer, useAdmin) Queries the target peer for the names of all the channels that a peer has joined. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer The target peer to send the query useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. An administrative identity must have been loaded by common connection profile or by using the 'setAdminSigningIdentity' method. Returns: A promise to return a ChannelQueryResponse Type Promise &lt;async&gt; queryInstalledChaincodes(peer, useAdmin) Queries the installed chaincodes on a peer. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer The target peer useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. An administrative identity must have been loaded by common connection profile or by using the 'setAdminSigningIdentity' method. Returns: Promise for a ChaincodeQueryResponse object Type Promise &lt;async&gt; queryPeers(request) Queries the target peer for a list of Peer objects of all peers known by the target peer. Parameters: Name Type Description request PeerQueryRequest The request parameters. Returns: The list of peer information Type PeerQueryResponse &lt;async&gt; saveUserToStateStore() Persist the current userContext to the key value store. Returns: A Promise for the userContext object upon successful persistence Type Promise setAdminSigningIdentity(private_key, certificate, mspid) Set the admin signing identity object. This method will only assign a signing identity for use by this client instance and will not persist the identity. Parameters: Name Type Description private_key string the private key PEM string certificate string the PEM-encoded string of certificate mspid string The Member Service Provider id for the local signing identity setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite) Sets the client instance to use the CryptoSuite object for signing and hashing Creating and setting a CryptoSuite is optional because the client will construct an instance based on default configuration settings: crypto-hsm: use an implementation for Hardware Security Module (if set to true) or software-based key management (if set to false) crypto-keysize: security level, or key size, to use with the digital signature public key algorithm. Currently ECDSA is supported and the valid key sizes are 256 and 384 crypto-hash-algo: hashing algorithm key-value-store: some CryptoSuite implementation requires a key store to persist private keys. A CryptoKeyStore is provided for this purpose, which can be used on top of any implementation of the KeyValueStore interface, such as a file-based store or a database-based one. The specific implementation is determined by the value of this configuration setting. Parameters: Name Type Description cryptoSuite module:api.CryptoSuite the CryptoSuite object Inherited From: BaseClient#setCryptoSuite Overrides: BaseClient#setCryptoSuite setDevMode(devMode) Set dev mode to true or false to reflect the mode of the fabric backend. See Client#isDevMode for details. Parameters: Name Type Description devMode boolean setStateStore(keyValueStore) Set an optional state store to persist application states. The state store must implement the module:api.KeyValueStore interface. The SDK supports persisting the User objects so that the heavy-weight objects such as the certificate and private keys do not have to be passed in repeatedly. Out of the box the SDK provides a file-based implementation, and a CouchDB-based implementation, which also supports Cloudant. Applications can provide alternative implementations. Parameters: Name Type Description keyValueStore module:api.KeyValueStore Instance of a KeyValueStore implementation setTlsClientCertAndKey(clientCert, clientKey) Sets the mutual TLS client side certificate and key necessary to build network endpoints when working with a common connection profile (connection profile). This must be called before a peer, orderer, or channel eventhub is needed. If the tls client material has not been provided for the client, it will be generated if the user has been assigned to this client. Note that it will always use the default software cryptosuite, not the one assigned to the client. Parameters: Name Type Description clientCert string The pem encoded client certificate. clientKey Array.&lt;byte&gt; The client key. &lt;async&gt; setUserContext(user, skipPersistence) Sets an instance of the User class as the security context of this client instance. This user’s signing identity (the private key and its corresponding certificate), will be used to sign all requests with the fabric backend. Upon setting the user context, the SDK saves the object in a persistence cache if the “state store” has been set on the Client instance. If no state store has been set, this cache will not be established and the application is responsible for setting the user context again if the application crashes and is recovered. Parameters: Name Type Description user User | UserNamePasswordObject An instance of the User class encapsulating the authenticated user’s signing materials (private key and enrollment certificate). The parameter may also be a UserNamePasswordObject that contains the username and optionally the password and caName. A common connection profile must has been loaded to use the UserNamePasswordObject which will also create the user context and set it on this client instance. The created user context will be based on the current network configuration( i.e. the current organization's CA, current persistence stores). skipPersistence boolean Whether to skip saving the user object into persistence. Default is false and the method will attempt to save the user object to the state store. When using a common connection profile and UserNamePasswordObject, the user object will always be stored to the persistence store. Returns: Promise of the 'user' object upon successful persistence of the user to the state store Type Promise signChannelConfig(loadConfig) Channel configuration updates can be sent to the orderers to be processed. The orderer enforces the Channel creation or update policies such that the updates will be made only when enough signatures from participating organizations are discovered in the request. Typically channel creation or update requests must be signed by participating organizations' ADMIN principals, although this policy can be customized when the consortium is defined. This method uses the client instance's current signing identity to sign over the configuration bytes passed in, and returns the signature that is ready to be included in the configuration update protobuf message to send to the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description loadConfig Array.&lt;byte&gt; The Configuration Update in byte form Returns: - The signature of the current user on the config bytes Type ConfigSignature updateChannel(request) Calls the orderer to update an existing channel. After the channel updates are successfully processed by the orderer, the orderer cuts a new block containing the new channel configuration and delivers it to all the participating peers in the channel. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChannelRequest The request object. Returns: Promise for a result object with status on the acceptance of the update request by the orderer. A channel update is finally completed when the new channel configuration block created by the orderer has been committed to the channel's peers. To be notified of the successful update of the channel, an application should use the ChannelEventHub to connect to the peers and register a block listener.

As a result the applications must design their handling of the transaction lifecycle in an asynchronous fashion. After the transaction proposal has been successfully endorsed, and before the transaction message has been successfully sent to the orderer, the application should register a listener to be notified when the transaction achieves finality, which is when the block containing the transaction gets added to the peer's ledger/blockchain. Fabric committing peers provide a block delivery service to publish blocks or filtered blocks to connected fabric-clients. See connect on connection options and how this ChannelEventHub may connect to the fabric service. For more information on the service see deliver. A block gets published whenever the committing peer adds a validated block to the ledger. When a fabric-client receives a block it will investigate the block and notify interested listeners with the related contents of the block (e.g. transactionId, status). There are three types of listeners that will get notified by the fabric-client after it receives a published block from the fabric deliver service. A \"block listener\" gets called for every block received. The listener will be passed a fully decoded Block object unless the connection to the fabric service is using filtered blocks. See registerBlockEvent A \"transaction listener\" gets called when the specific transaction is committed (discovered inside a published block). The listener may also be registered to listen to \"all\" transactions. The listener will be passed the transaction id, transaction status and block number. See registerTxEvent A \"chaincode event listener\" gets called when a specific chaincode event is discovered within a block. The listener will be passed the block number, transaction id, and transaction status. The ChaincodeEvent will be also be passed, however the payload of the event will not be passed if the connection to the fabric service is publishing filtered blocks. See registerChaincodeEvent When the fabric-client connects to the peer, it tells the peer which block to begin delivering from. If no start block is provided, then the client will only receive events for the most recently committed block onwards. To avoid missing events in blocks that are published while the client is crashed/offline, the client should record the most recently processed block, and resume event delivery from this block number on startup. In this way, there is no custom recovery path for missed events, and the normal processing code may execute instead. You may also include an endBlock number if you wish to stop listening after receiving a range of events. Example const eh = channel.newChannelEventHub(peer); // register the listener before calling \"connect()\" so there // is an error callback ready to process an error in case the // connect() call fails eh.registerTxEvent( 'all', // this listener will be notified of all transactions (tx, status, block_num) =&gt; { record(tx, status, block_num); console.log(util.format('Transaction %s has completed', tx)); }, (err) =&gt; { eh.unregisterTxEvent('all'); reportError(err); console.log(util.format('Error %s! Transaction listener has been ' + 'deregistered for %s', err, eh.getPeerAddr())); } ); eh.connect(); × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

Note that administrative capabilities, such as installing and starting smart contracts, are not currently provided by this API. For these tasks or other specific advanced usage, the lower level fabric-client API should be used. Access to related fabric-client objects is provided through the fabric-network API objects. TypeScript definitions are included in this module. Getting started The entry point used to interact with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is the Gateway class. This provides a connection to a peer within the blockchain network, and enables access to any of the blockchain Networks (channels) for which that peer is a member. This in turn provides access to Smart Contracts (chaincode) running within that blockchain network, and to which Transactions can be submitted or queries can be evaluated. Private data can be submitted to transactions as transient data to prevent it from being recorded on the ledger. Example // Obtain the smart contract with which our application wants to interact const wallet = new FileSystemWallet(walletDirectoryPath); const gatewayOptions: GatewayOptions = { identity: 'user@example.org', // Previously imported identity wallet, }; const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(commonConnectionProfile, gatewayOptions); const network = await gateway.getNetwork(channelName); const contract = network.getContract(chaincodeId); // Submit transactions or evaluate queries for the smart contract const result = await contract.createTransaction(transactionName) .setTransient(privateData) .submit(arg1, arg2); Classes AbstractEventHubSelectionStrategy AbstractEventListener BaseCheckpointer BaseWallet CommitEventListener Contract ContractEventListener CouchDBWallet EventHubManager FileSystemCheckpointer FileSystemWallet Gateway HSMWalletMixin InMemoryWallet Network Query RoundRobinEventHubSelectionStrategy TimeoutError Transaction TransactionError X509WalletMixin Type Definitions DefaultEventHandlerStrategies Properties: Name Type Description MSPID_SCOPE_ALLFORTX Listen for transaction commit events from all peers in the client identity's organization.

Contract Represents a smart contract (chaincode) instance in a network. Applications should get a Contract instance using the networks's getContract method. new Contract() Methods &lt;async&gt; addContractListener(listenerName, callback [, options] [, eventHub]) Create a commit event listener for this transaction. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description listenerName string The name of the listener callback function This callback will be triggered when a transaction commit event is emitted. It takes parameters of error, event payload, block number, transaction ID and status options module:fabric-network.Network~ListenerOptions &lt;optional&gt; Optional. Options on registrations allowing start and end block numbers. eventHub ChannelEventHub &lt;optional&gt; Optional. Used to override the event hub selection Returns: Type module:fabric-network~CommitEventListener addDiscoveryInterest(interest) Provide a Discovery Interest settings to help the peer's discovery service build an endorsement plan. This chaincode Id will be include by default in the list of discovery interests. If this contract's chaincode is in one or more collections then use this method with this chaincode Id to change the default discovery interest to include those collection names. Parameters: Name Type Description interest DiscoveryInterest These will be added to the existing discovery interests to be used as the \"endorsement_hint\" attribute of the request when the module:fabric-network.Transaction#submit performs a Channel#sendTransactionProposal createTransaction(name) Create an object representing a specific invocation of a transaction function implemented by this contract, and provides more control over the transaction invocation. A new transaction object must be created for each transaction invocation. Parameters: Name Type Description name String Transaction function name. Returns: A transaction object. Type module:fabric-network.Transaction &lt;async&gt; evaluateTransaction(name [, args]) Evaluate a transaction function and return its results. The transaction function name will be evaluated on the endorsing peers but the responses will not be sent to the ordering service and hence will not be committed to the ledger. This is used for querying the world state. This function is equivalent to calling createTransaction(name).evaluate(). Parameters: Name Type Argument Description name string Transaction function name. args string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; Transaction function arguments. Returns: Payload response from the transaction function. Type Buffer getDiscoveryInterests() Retrieve the Discovery Interest settings that will help the peer's discovery service build an endorsement plan. Returns: - This will be used as the endorsement_hint when the Channel performs the Channel#sendTransactionProposal Type Array.&lt;DiscoveryInterest&gt; &lt;async&gt; submitTransaction(name [, args]) Submit a transaction to the ledger. The transaction function name will be evaluated on the endorsing peers and then submitted to the ordering service for committing to the ledger. This function is equivalent to calling createTransaction(name).submit(). Parameters: Name Type Argument Description name string Transaction function name. args string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; Transaction function arguments. Throws: If the transaction was successfully submitted to the orderer but timed out before a commit event was received from peers.

Gateway The gateway peer provides the connection point for an application to access the Fabric network. It is instantiated using the default constructor. It can then be connected to a fabric network using the connect method by passing either a CCP definition or an existing Client object. Once connected, it can then access individual Network instances (channels) using the getNetwork method which in turn can access the smart contracts installed on a network and submit transactions to the ledger. new Gateway() Methods &lt;async&gt; connect(config, options) Connect to the Gateway with a connection profile or a prebuilt Client instance. Parameters: Name Type Description config string | object | Client The configuration for this Gateway which can be: A fully qualified common connection profile file path (String) A common connection profile JSON (Object) A pre-configured client instance options module:fabric-network.Gateway~GatewayOptions specific options for creating this Gateway instance Example const gateway = new Gateway(); const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('./WALLETS/wallet'); const ccpFile = fs.readFileSync('./network.json'); const ccp = JSON.parse(ccpFile.toString()); await gateway.connect(ccp, { identity: 'admin', wallet: wallet }); disconnect() Clean up and disconnect this Gateway connection in preparation for it to be discarded and garbage collected getClient() Get the underlying Client object instance Returns: The underlying client instance Type Client getCurrentIdentity() Get the current identity Returns: The current identity used by this Gateway.

Transaction Represents a specific invocation of a transaction function, and provides felxibility over how that transaction is invoked. Applications should obtain instances of this class by calling Contract#createTransaction(). Instances of this class are stateful. A new instance must be created for each transaction invocation. new Transaction() Methods &lt;async&gt; addCommitListener(callback [, options] [, eventHub]) Create a commit event listener for this transaction. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description callback function This callback will be triggered when a transaction commit event is emitted. It takes parameters of error, transactionId, transaction status and block number options module:fabric-network.Network~ListenerOptions &lt;optional&gt; Optional. Options on registrations allowing start and end block numbers. eventHub ChannelEventHub &lt;optional&gt; Optional. Used to override the event hub selection Returns: Type module:fabric-network~CommitEventListener &lt;async&gt; evaluate( [args]) Evaluate a transaction function and return its results. The transaction function will be evaluated on the endorsing peers but the responses will not be sent to the ordering service and hence will not be committed to the ledger. This is used for querying the world state. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description args String &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; Transaction function arguments. Returns: Payload response from the transaction function. Type Buffer getName() Get the fully qualified name of the transaction function. Returns: Transaction name. Type String getNetwork() Returns the network from the contract Returns: Type module:fabric-network.Network getTransactionID() Get the ID that will be used for this transaction invocation. Returns: Transaction ID. Type module:fabric-client.TransactionID setEndorsingOrganizations(orgs) Set the organizations that should be used for endorsement when this transaction is submitted to the ledger. Peers that are in the organizations will be used for the endorsement. This will override the setEndorsingPeers if previously called. Setting the endorsing organizations will not override discovery, however it will filter the peers provided by discovery to be those in these organizatons. If discovery is not used then this will target all endorsing peers in each of the specified organizations. Use setEndorsingPeers instead when not using discovery if you don't want all peers targetted in an organization. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description orgs string &lt;repeatable&gt; Endorsing organizations. Returns: This object, to allow function chaining. Type module:fabric-network.Transaction setEndorsingPeers(peers) Set the peers that should be used for endorsement when this transaction is submitted to the ledger. Parameters: Name Type Description peers Array.&lt;ChannelPeer&gt; Endorsing peers. Returns: This object, to allow function chaining. Type module:fabric-network.Transaction setTransient(transientMap) Set transient data that will be passed to the transaction function but will not be stored on the ledger. This can be used to pass private data to a transaction function. Parameters: Name Type Description transientMap Object Object with String property names and Buffer property values. Returns: This object, to allow function chaining. Type module:fabric-network.Transaction &lt;async&gt; submit( [args]) Submit a transaction to the ledger. The transaction function name will be evaluated on the endorsing peers and then submitted to the ordering service for committing to the ledger. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description args String &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; Transaction function arguments. Throws: If the transaction was successfully submitted to the orderer but timed out before a commit event was received from peers. Type module:fabric-network.TimeoutError if an underlying infrastructure failure occurs. The `responses` property of the error contains the array of proposal response objects from the endorsing peers. Type Error Returns: Payload response from the transaction function. Type Buffer × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

The orderer node exposes two APIs: broadcast() and deliver(). Both are streaming APIs so there's a persistent grpc streaming connection between the client and the orderer where messages are exchanged in both directions. The broadcast() API is for sending transactions to the orderer for processing. The deliver() API is for asking the orderer for information such as channel configurations. new Orderer(url, opts) Constructs an Orderer object with the given url and opts. An orderer object encapsulates the properties of an orderer node and the interactions with it via the grpc stream API. Orderer objects are used by the Client objects to broadcast requests for creating and updating channels. They are also used by the Channel objects to broadcast requests for ordering transactions. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of \"grpc(s)://host:port\". opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the orderer. Returns: The Orderer instance. Type Orderer Extends Remote Methods close() Close the service connection. getCharacteristics() Get this remote endpoints characteristics It's name, url, and connection options are the items that make this instance unique.

The ECert must have been signed by one of the CAs the blockchain network has been configured to trust. An enrolled user (having a signing key and ECert) can conduct chaincode instantiate, transactions and queries with the Channel. User ECerts can be obtained from a CA beforehand as part of installing and instantiating the application, or it can be obtained from the optional Fabric CA service via its enrollment process. Sometimes User identities are confused with Peer identities. User identities represent signing capability because it has access to the private key, while Peer identities in the context of the application/SDK only has the certificate for verifying signatures. An application cannot use the Peer identity to sign things because the application doesn’t have access to the Peer identity’s private key. new User(cfg) Constructor for a member.

At a high level, a business application running on a Hyperledger Fabric network is made up of two parts: chaincode that runs in the servers (endorser nodes), and client code that runs in the Node.js application. For chaincode development, please visit the Hyperledger Fabric chaincode tutorials. For complete information on starting a Hyperledger Fabric network, please see the Build your first network tutorial. The following tutorial assumes a chaincode has been developed and the focus is developing the client application. What makes up a Hyperledger Fabric application development environment? Below you'll find a high level summary of the Hyperledger Fabric design aimed at an introductory level of understanding, so that you can be on your way to setting up the development environment. For a comprehensive description of the concepts, the architecture, please visit the official Hyperledger Fabric documentation. First of all, you will need an orderer. But isn't an orderer responsible for the consensus? Why start here? It's true that the main responsibility of the ordering service of a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is to provide consensus on a transaction among the maintainers of the ledger, a.k.a the committer nodes. However, the ordering service also maintains critical data about the overall network: what organizations are participating, what channels have been created, which organizations are part of a given channel, and last but not least what policies are in place for any kind of change to the network. In essence, the ordering service holds the network together. Ok we've got to have an orderer node so we can add participating organizations to it and get a network started. Next you would need peers for each participating organization in order to participate in transaction endorsing and maintaining the ledger. The peer nodes play two roles: endorser and committer. A peer's endorser role may be enabled or disabled based on the bootstrap configuration. Note that all peers are always committers. For high availability you would want more than one peer for each organization in a real deployment. For the development environment, one peer per organization is sufficient under most circumstances. This peer will be both an endorser and a committer. It will be sent transaction proposals to endorse and queries to discover information from the ledger. Another important role that peer nodes play is broadcasting events to interested parties. Whenever a block is added to the ledger, an event is sent by the peer through a dedicated streaming port. Any application within the organization can register themselves to listen on that port to get notified. The final piece of the puzzle is identities. Every operation in a Hyperledger Fabric network must be digitally signed for the purposes of access control, or provenance/auditing (who did what), or both. Identities are based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)) standards. Every orderer node, every peer node and every user/transactor must have a key pair with the public key wrapped in a x.509 certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). Since x.509 is an open standard, Hyperledger Fabric would work with any existing certificate authority. This is typically a painful process with lots of potential red tape to get real certificates, so for the development purposes it is a popular practice to use self-signed certificates locally generated. As you will see in the later section, the Hyperledger Fabric provides tools to make this less painful. Also related to identities, you should make a decision on whether Fabric-CA should be part of your solution. This is a server with REST APIs that supports dynamic identity management with registration, enrollment (getting certificates), revocation and re-enrollment. So it is very useful in providing user identities on the fly. Note that user identities provisioned this way are only of the MEMBER role, which means it won't be able to perform certain operations reserved for the ADMIN role: create/update channel install/instantiate chaincode query installed/instantiated chaincodes For these privileged operations, the client must use an ADMIN user to submit the request. If you choose to not use Fabric-CA, everything will still work, but the application is responsible for managing the user certificates. Prerequisites You will need the following software: Docker and Docker Compose - see Hyperledger Fabric for details Nodejs v8.9.0 or higher, up to 9.0 ( Node v9.0+ is not supported ) Prepare crypto materials As discussed above, identities are established with x.509 certificates. If you think about it, we will need a whole bunch of certificates because there are many identities involved: peers need identities to sign endorsements orderers need identities to sign proposed blocks for the committers to validate and append to the ledger applications need identities to sign transaction requests the Fabric CA themselves also need identities, so their signatures in the certificates can be validated Luckily there is a tool for that. Follow this guide to use the cryptogen tool to generate all the required keys and certificates in one swoop. Note that the cryptogen tool will automatically generate identities for the Fabric CA nodes for each orderer and peer organization, which can be used to start the Fabric-CA servers (if you choose to use it as part of the solution as discussed above). In addition, it also generates one admin user of the ADMIN role with the privileges to perform admin-level operations listed above. Finally, it also generates regular users (MEMBER role) for submitting transactions. This would get us all the crypto materials needed to start things up. Getting things rolling for real - the genesis block As discussed above, the orderer should be the first step to bootstrap (launch) a network. The orderer will need the initial configurations wrapped inside a genesis block. Follow the instructions here to use the configtxgen tool to generate a genesis.block. The output, a genesis block file for the orderer, will be used in the next step to launch the orderer node. Notice some features are non-backwards compatible. To enable features from a particular fabric version, the Capabilities section in configtx.yaml should be updated before generate the genesis.block. Start the network Now we are ready to put it all together. The easiest way to launch the development environment is to use docker-compose. Follow the instructions here to start the network. To minimize the chances of a mistake, you may wish to run the network without TLS. The above steps give you a development environment. Now before you can ask it to process any transactions, you must first create a channel.

It shows how to use an initial (default) channel definition and how to start with that definition to build a custom definition. The process to create a network and channels also involves creating and working with cryptographic material, this will not be discussed here. For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration cryptographic generation see cryptogen configuration transaction generator see configtxgen configuration translation tool see configtxlator The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), protobuf, and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. The examples shown below are based on the balance-transfer sample application. see Hyperledger Fabric Samples steps of a channel create: run the configtxgen tool to generate a genesis block run the configtxgen tool to generate an initial binary configuration definition get a sign-able channel definition in one of two ways use the initial binary channel configuration definition use the fabric-client SDK to extract the sign-able channel definition from the initial binary channel configuration definition build a custom definition use the configtxlator to convert the initial binary channel configuration definition to readable text edit the readable text more info use the configtxlator to convert the edited text to a sign-able channel definition use the fabric-client SDK to sign the sign-able channel definition use the fabric-client SDK to send the signatures and the sign-able channel definition to the orderer use the fabric-client SDK to have the peer join the channel then new channel may be used Use the initial definition to build a sign-able channel definition The initial binary channel configuration definition generated by the configtxgen tool is a binary file containing the Hyperledger Fabric configuration protobuf common.Envelope element. Inside this element is the common.ConfigUpdate protobuf element. This configuration element is the one that must be signed. A profile element in the configtx.yaml is the source for the initial binary channel configuration definition created by the configtxgen tool. ../../../bin/configtxgen -channelID mychannel -outputCreateChannelTx mychannel.tx -profile TwoOrgsChannel Have the fabric-client SDK extract the config update element from the mychannel.tx file // first read in the file, this gives us a binary config envelope let envelope_bytes = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'fabric-samples/balance-transfer/artifacts/channel/mychannel.tx')); // have the nodeSDK extract out the config update var config_update = client.extractChannelConfig(envelope_bytes); The binary config_update may now be used in the signing process and sent to the orderer for channel creation. You may ask why is a common.ConfigUpdate used for a create. This makes the process of create and update the same. The create of a new channel is a delta on what is defined in the system channel and an update is a delta on what is defined in the channel. The common.ConfigUpdate object submitted will only contain the changes for both a create and an update. Creating a custom sign-able channel definition The easiest way to get started with creating a custom channel configuration is to have the configtxlator convert an existing binary that has been or could be used to create a new channel to human readable JSON. There are many elements of the configuration and it would be very difficult to start with nothing. Using the same configtx.yaml file used to generate your Hyperledger Fabric network, use the configtxgen tool to create a initial binary configuration definition for a new channel. Then by sending that binary to the configtxlator to convert it to JSON, you will be able to see the layout and have a starting point. That JSON could also be used as a template for creating other new channels on your network. A new channel will inherit settings from the system channel for settings not defined in the new channel configuration. Organizations that will be on the new channel must be defined in a consortium on the system channel. Therefore having the readable definition of the system channel of your network would be helpful when creating a new channel. Send the genesis.block that was used to start the Hyperledger Fabric network to the configtxlator to get a JSON file to be used as a reference. Use the configtxgen tool to produce the binary config files. From the sample directory fabric-samples/balance-transfer/artifacts/channel. export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD ../../../bin/configtxgen -outputBlock genesis.block -profile TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis ../../../bin/configtxgen -channelID mychannel -outputCreateChannelTx mychannel.tx -profile TwoOrgsChannel Send the two binary files to the configtxlator service. Since this step is done only once and does not require a Node.js application, we will use cURL to simplify and speed up getting the results. Notice that configtxlator service path has decode (convert from binary to JSON). The path must also include the type of object of the binary, in the first case, it is a common.Block. The \"decode\" or \"encode\" may be done for any of the protobuf message object types found in the fabric-client\\lib\\protos directory protobuf files. First start the configtxlator service, from the fabric-samples/bin directory ./configtxlator start Then curl -X POST --data-binary @genesis.block http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/decode/common.Block &gt; genesis.json curl -X POST --data-binary @mychannel.tx http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/decode/common.Envelope &gt; mychannel.json The results of decoding the file mychannel.tx which is a common.Envelope produced by the configtxgen tool contains a common.ConfigUpdate object. This object has the name \"config_update\" within the \"payload.data\" JSON object. This is the object that is needed as the source of the template to be used for creating new channels. The common.ConfigUpdate is the object that will be signed by all organizations and submitted to the orderer to create a new channel. The following is the extracted JSON \"config_update\" (common.ConfigUpdate) object from the decode of the \"TwoOrgsChannel\" channel create binary generated above. { \"channel_id\": \"mychannel\", \"read_set\": { \"groups\": { \"Application\": { \"groups\": { \"Org1MSP\": {} } } }, \"values\": { \"Consortium\": { \"value\": { \"name\": \"SampleConsortium\" } } } }, \"write_set\": { \"groups\": { \"Application\": { \"groups\": { \"Org1MSP\": {} }, \"mod_policy\": \"Admins\", \"policies\": { \"Admins\": { \"policy\": { \"type\": 3, \"value\": { \"rule\": \"MAJORITY\", \"sub_policy\": \"Admins\" } } }, \"Readers\": { \"policy\": { \"type\": 3, \"value\": { \"sub_policy\": \"Readers\" } } }, \"Writers\": { \"policy\": { \"type\": 3, \"value\": { \"sub_policy\": \"Writers\" } } } }, \"version\": \"1\" } }, \"values\": { \"Consortium\": { \"value\": { \"name\": \"SampleConsortium\" } } } } } Note that the Consortium name used must exist on the system channel. All organizations that you wish to add to the new channel must be defined under in the Consortium section with that name on the system channel. Use the decoded genesis block to verify all values, for example by looking in the genesis.json file generated above. To add an organizations to the channel, they must be placed under the groups section under the Applications section as shown above. See that Org1MSP is a property of Applications.groups section. In this example all of the settings for the organization Org1MSP will be inherited from the system channel (notice the empty object \"{}\" for this organization's properties). To see the current settings for this organization look within the SampleConsortium section under the Consortium section of the system channel (the genesis block of the system channel). Once you have a JSON configuration representing your channel, send it the configtxlator to be encoded into a configuration binary. The following example of sending a REST request to the configtxlator uses the Node.js package superagent because of the ease of use for HTTP requests. var response = superagent.post('http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/encode/common.ConfigUpdate', config_json.toString()) .buffer() .end((err, res) =&gt; { if(err) { logger.error(err); return; } config_proto = res.body; }); Signing and submitting the channel update The binary configuration must be signed by all organizations. The application will have to store the binary configuration and have it available to be signed along with storing all the signatures as it collects them. Then once the signing is complete, the application will send the binary configuration and all the signatures to the orderer using the fabric-client SDK API createChannel(). First the signing, assuming the client fabric-client SDK object has a valid user in a required organization var signature = client.signChannelConfig(config_proto); signatures.push(signature); Now it is time for the channel create, assuming that the signatures object is an array of common.ConfigSignature returned by the client.signChannelConfig() method. Note: The orderer must be started with the genesis.block that was generated from the same configuration file as the initial binary channel configuration definition // create an orderer object to represent the orderer of the network var orderer = client.newOrderer(url,opts); // have the SDK generate a transaction id let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); request = { config: config_proto, //the binary config signatures : signatures, // the collected signatures name : 'mychannel', // the channel name orderer : orderer, //the orderer from above txId : tx_id //the generated transaction id }; // this call will return a Promise client.createChannel(request) The createChannel API returns a Promise to return the status of the submit. The channel create will take place asynchronously by the orderer. After a small delay of a few seconds the channel will have been created by the orderer and may now be joined by the peers. Issue the following to the peers that are required on the channel. This is a two step process of first getting the genesis block of the channel and then sending it to the peer. In the following example the genesis block was retrieved from the orderer, but could have also been loaded from a file. // set the channel up with network endpoints var orderer = client.newOrderer(orderer_url,orderer_opts); channel.addOrderer(orderer); var peer = client.newPeer(peer_url,peer_opts); channel.addPeer(peer); tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); let g_request = { txId : tx_id }; // get the genesis block from the orderer channel.getGenesisBlock(g_request).then((block) =&gt;{ genesis_block = block; tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); let j_request = { targets : targets, block : genesis_block, txId : tx_id }; // send genesis block to the peer return channel.joinChannel(j_request); }).then((results) =&gt;{ if(results &amp;&amp; results.response &amp;&amp; results.response.status == 200) { // join successful } else { // not good } }); This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

Channel-based events are a new feature of the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js client as of v1.1. It replaces the event hub from v1.0, with a more useful and reliable interface for applications to receive events. For more information on getting started with Fabric check out Building your first network. The following assumes an understanding of Fabric networks (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. Overview A client application may use the Fabric Node.js client to register a \"listener\" to receive blocks as they are added to the channel ledger. We call these \"channel-based events\", and they allow a client to start to receive blocks from a specific block number, allowing event processing to run normally on blocks that may have been missed. The Fabric Node.js client can also assist client applications by processing the incoming blocks and looking for specific transactions or chaincode events. This allows a client application to be notified of transaction completion or arbitrary chaincode events without having to perform multiple queries or search through the blocks as they are received. Applications may use block or chaincode events to provide channel data to other applications. For example an application could listen for block events and write transaction data to a data store for the purpose of performing queries or other analytics against the channel's data. For each block received, the block listener application could iterate through the block transactions, and build a data store using the key/value writes from each valid transaction's 'rwset' (see the Block and Transaction Type Definitions for details of these data structures). The event service also allows applications to receive \"filtered\" block events (which allow for receiving transaction validation status without providing other sensitive information). Access to \"filtered\" and \"unfiltered\" events can be configured independently in Fabric. The default behavior is to connect to receive filtered block events. To connect to receive unfiltered block events call connect(true) (see below). Note that if you register for a block event and then submit a transaction, you should not make any assumptions about which block contains your transaction. In particular, you should not assume that your transaction is in the block associated with the first block event received after registration to the peer's channel-based event service. Instead, you may simply register for a transaction event. Channel APIs newChannelEventHub(peer) -- A Channel instance method to get a new instance of a ChannelEventHub. getChannelEventHubsForOrg -- Gets a list of ChannelEventHubs based on an organization. If the organization name is omitted then the current organization of the current user is used. ChannelEventHub APIs registerBlockEvent(eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) -- To register for block events. unregisterBlockEvent(reg_num) -- To remove a block registration. registerTxEvent(tx_id, eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) -- To register for a specific transaction event. unregisterTxEvent(tx_id) -- To remove a specific transaction registration. registerChaincodeEvent(ccid, eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) -- To register for chaincode events. unregisterChaincodeEvent(cc_handle) -- To remove a chaincode event registration. connect({full_block: true}) -- To have the client channel event hub connect with the fabric channel-based event service. This call must be made before events will be received by your instance of a ChannelEventHub. When the channel-based event hub connects with the service, it will request to receive blocks or filtered blocks. If the full_block parameter is omitted, it will default to false and filtered blocks will be requested. Receiving blocks or filtered blocks can not be changed once connect() is called. When replaying blocks (by setting the startBlock and endBlock) connect() must be called after registering the listener as the connection to the peer must be setup to request existing blocks. disconnect() -- To have the client channel event hub shutdown the connection to the fabric network channel-based event service and notify all current channel event registrations of the shutdown by using the registered errorCallBacks. peer parameter This parameter must be included when getting a new instance of the ChannelEventHub. The value may be a Peer instance or the name of a peer when using a connection profile see How to use a common common connection profile file. eventCallback parameter This parameter must be included. This is the callback function to be notified when this channel receives a new block, when listening for a specific transaction or chaincode events. errorCallback parameter This is an optional parameter. This is the callback function to be notified when this channel event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a fabric network error, network connection problem or by a call to the disconnect() method. This callback will also be called when the channel event hub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying with the endBlock set to 'newest'. options parameter This is an optional parameter. This parameter will contain the following optional properties: {integer | 'newest' | 'oldest' | 'last_seen'} startBlock (Optional) The starting block number for event checking. When included, the Peer's channel-based event service will be asked to start sending blocks from this block number. This is how to resume listening or replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. This option changes how the connection is made to the fabric Peer's channel-based event service, therefore the registration must be made before the channel event hub has setup the connection. Replaying events may confuse other event listeners; therefore, only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when startBlock and/or endBlock are used on a listener registration. Number - A number value may be specified as the block number. 'newest' - The string of 'newest'. This will have the block number determined by the Peer's channel-based event service at connect time of the the newest block on the ledger. 'oldest' - The string of 'oldest'. This will have the block number determined by the Peer's channel-based event service at connect time of the the oldest block on the ledger, unless your ledger has been pruned, this will be block 0. 'last_seen' - The string of 'oldest'. This will have the channel event hub instance determine the block number at the time of the registration. The number will be based on the last block that this channel event hub has received from the Peer's channel-based event service. Using this option on an event listener does require that this channel event hub has been previously running. {integer | 'newest' | 'oldest' | 'last_seen' } endBlock (Optional) The ending block number for event checking. When included, the Peer's channel-based event service will be asked to stop sending blocks once this block is delivered. This is how to replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. When a startBlock is not included, the endBlock must be equal to or larger than the current channel block height. This option changes how the connection is made to the fabric Peer's channel-based event service, therefore the registration must be made before the channel event hub has setup the connection. Replaying events may confuse other event listeners; therefore, only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when startBlock and/or endBlock are used. The value 'newest' will indicate that 'endBlock' will be calculated by the peer as the newest block on the ledger. This allows the application to replay up to the latest block on the ledger and then the listener will stop and be notified by the 'onError' callback. Number - A number value may be specified as the block number. 'newest' - The string of 'newest'. This will have the block number determined by the Peer's channel-based event service at connect time of the the newest block on the ledger. 'oldest' - The string of 'oldest'. This will have the block number determined by the Peer's channel-based event service at connect time of the the oldest block on the ledger, unless your ledger has been pruned, this will be block 0. 'last_seen' - The string of 'oldest'. This will have the channel event hub instance determine the block number at the time of the registration. The number will be based on the last block that this channel event hub has received from the Peer's channel-based event service. Using this option on an event listener does require that this channel event hub has been previously running. {boolean} unregister -- (Optional) This setting indicates that the registration should be removed (unregister) after the event is seen. When the application is using a timeout to only wait a specified amount of time for the transaction to be seen, the timeout processing should include the manual 'unregister' of the transaction event listener to avoid the event callbacks being called unexpectedly. The default for this setting is different for the different types of event listeners. For block listeners the default is true when an end_block was set as a option, the listener will be active and receiving blocks until the end block is received and then the listener will be automatically unregistered. For transaction listeners the default is true and once the transaction event has occurred the listener will be automatically unregistered. If the transaction listener has used an endBlock, the default will be to automatically unregister the listener even if the transaction has not been seen. For chaincode event listeners the default will be false as the match filter might be intended for many transactions, however if the chaincode event listener has set an endBlock it will be automatically unregistered after the endBlock is seen. {boolean} disconnect -- (Optional) This setting indicates to the ChannelEventHub instance to automatically disconnect itself from the peer's channel-based event service once the event has been seen. The default is false. When not set and the endBlock has been set the ChannelEventHub instance will automatically disconnect itself. {boolean} as_array -- (Optional) This setting indicates to the ChannelEventHub instance to send all chaincode events to the callback as array rather than one at a time. This setting is only available for chaincode events. How to use a Channel Event Hub The ChannelEventHub class is very flexible. It allows for many usage models. waiting for my transaction to complete looking at chaincode events auditing a channel for all new blocks replay events Transaction events A majority of users will need to know when a transaction is committed to the ledger. All transactions have an unique identifier that may be monitored. Users may register an event listener to indicate that a specific transaction has been written to the ledger. This will be known as a transaction event. Steps to be notified for a transaction event: Get a channel event hub instance, this may be done for every transaction or may be done once and reused. Connect the channel event hub instance with the peer's event service. You may wish to connect before registering when reusing the ChannelEventHub instance for many transactions. Create transaction and have it endorsed. Register your callback using the transaction ID string of the transaction with the channel event hub instance. Connect the channel event hub if not already connected. Submit the endorsed transaction to be ordered. Wait to be notified of the transaction being committed to the ledger or timeout if there is an issue. Unregister the event listener when transaction is seen, which will be done automatically by default. Disconnect the channel event hub when finished listening, which could be done automatically if configured. Chaincode events Chaincode programs running on the fabric network are able to add into a transaction a name and a value, this is known as a chaincode event. The \"name\" will most likely not be unique and more than one transaction may contain the chaincode event name, therefore the listener callback may be called many times. The listener may be setup to use a regular expression when looking for a name match such that a single listener may be notified with many different names. NOTE: Chaincode events must be committed and written to the ledger before a listener will be notified. The ChannelEventHub instance will not see chaincode events in transactions until the transactions commits and is written to the peer's ledger on the peer that ChannelEventHub has connected to the event service. Steps to be notified when a chaincode event occurs: Get a channel event hub instance, this should be done once and reused. Connect the channel event hub instance with the peer's event service. You may wish to connect before registering when reusing the ChannelEventHub instance for many transactions. Register your callback with the name of the chaincode event, you may use a regular expression to match on more than one name. Connect the channel event hub if not already connected. Somewhere on the network a transaction is endorsed and committed containing a chaincode event. Process the chaincode events as they come in. Unregister the event listener when finished. Disconnect the channel event hub when finished listening. Block events Once a ChannelEventHub connects to the Peer's event service it will start receiving blocks as they are added to the ledger, unless a \"startBlock\" is specified, then it will start receiving blocks from the block specified. When a block is received by the ChannelEventHub instance from the Peer's event service, this is known as a block event, Steps to be notified when a block event occurs: Get a channel event hub instance. Register to receive blocks. Connect the channel event hub instance with the peer's event service. Somewhere on the network a transaction is endorsed and committed. Process the blocks as they come in. Disconnect the channel event hub when finished listening. Steps to be notified when a block event occurs: Get a channel event hub instance. Register to receive blocks. Connect the channel event hub instance with the peer's event service. Somewhere on the network a transaction is endorsed and committed. Process the blocks as they come in. Disconnect the channel event hub when finished listening. Replay events If you wish to look at events that already happened, use the \"startBlock\" option to replay the events. Using the start block will connect to the Peer's event service and have it start sending existing blocks starting with the block number specified rather than the latest block. Blocks will be continued to be sent until the \"endBlock\" is seen. If no end block is specified, then blocks will continue to be sent as they are added to the ledger. Replay may be used to look again for your transaction or chaincode events when your application was off-line. When not specifying an end block the channel event hub may continued to be used to monitor for new events as they happen on the channel after catching up on existing events. Steps to be notified when a replay event occurs: Get a channel event hub instance. Register to receive your events. Connect the channel event hub instance with the peer's event service using a \"startBlock\" Process the events as they come in. Disconnect the channel event hub when finished listening. Get a Channel Event Hub Use the fabric-client Channel newChannelEventHub object to create new instances of ChannelEventHub objects. Use the following to get a ChannelEventHub instances that will be setup to work with the Peer's channel-based event service. A ChannelEventHub instance will use all the same endpoint configuration settings that the peer instance is using, like the tls certs and the host and port address. When using a connection profile (see) then the peer's name may be used to get a new channel event hub. // peer is a instance const channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub(peer); // using the peer name const channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub('peer0.org1.example.com'); When using a connection profile (see How to use a common common connection profile file) then the peer's name may be used to get a channel event hub. This will return the same ChannelEventHub instance each time the \"getChannelEventHub\" is called. // must use peer name const channel_event_hub = channel.getChannelEventHub('peer0.org1.example.com'); Here is an example of how to get a list of channel event hubs when using a connection profile. The following will get a list based on the current organization that is defined in the currently active client section of the connection profile. Peers defined in the organization that have the eventSource set to true will be added to the list. const channel_event_hubs = channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg(); When creating a peer instance, you can get a ChannelEventHub instance by using the peer instance. const data = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'somepath/tlscacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem')); const peer = client.newPeer( 'grpcs://localhost:7051', { pem: Buffer.from(data).toString(), 'ssl-target-name-override': 'peer0.org1.example.com' } ); const channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub(peer); Connect a Channel Event Hub Once you have a ChannelEventHub instance you will need to connect to the peer's event service. The \"connect\" call setups up a connection to the peer's event service. The connection with the peer's event service must indicate which blocks to receive. By default the ChannelEventHub will specify the latest block as the starting point. This is usually the point on the ledger where monitoring is required. Users may specify both a starting point and an ending point. Specifying a \"startBlock\" is useful when the application needs to look at existing transactions, chaincode events, or blocks. The connect call may be made before or after registration, however start blocks and end blocks may not be changed after the connect call is made. The connection with the peer's event service must also indicate full blocks or filtered blocks. By default the connection will be setup to receive filtered blocks as this contains transaction status and does not contain sensitive data. The best practice is to connect before registering for transaction events and provide a callback. const channel_event_hub = ... channel_event_hub.connect({full_block: false}, (err, status) =&gt; { if (err) { // process the error } else { // connect was good } }); channel_event_hub.register... The best practice is connect after registering for chaincode events or block events. connecting after allows the connect to easily be modified to include the \"startBlock\" (for replay) and not change the flow. Since filtered blocks contain very little information, chaincode events and block events may not be useful unless full blocks are received. The user performing the connect must have the access authority to see full blocks. const channel_event_hub = ... channel_event_hub.register... channel_event_hub.connect({full_block: true}, (err, status) =&gt; { if (err) { // process the error } else { // connect was good } }); With replay, notice that the user gets the start block from a previous ChannelEventHub. const channel_event_hub = ... const my_start = old_channel_event_hub.lastBlockNumber(); channel_event_hub.register... channel_event_hub.connect({full_block: true, startBlock: my_start}, (err, status) =&gt; { if (err) { // process the error } else { // connect was good } }); Block Listener When there is a need to monitor for new blocks being added to the ledger, use a block event listener. The Fabric client Node.js will be notified when a new block is committed to the ledger on the peer. The client Node.js will then call the registered callback of the application program. The callback will be passed a JSON representation of the newly added block. Note that when connect() is not called with a true value the callback will receive a filtered block. The access rights of the user registering to receive full blocks will be checked by the peer's channel-based event service. When there is a need to see previously added blocks, the registration of the callback may include a starting block number. The callback will start receiving blocks from this number and continue to receive new blocks as they are added to the ledger. This is a way for the application to resume and replay events that may have been lost if the application were to be offline. The application should remember the last block it has processed to avoid replaying the entire ledger. The following example will register a block listener to start receiving new blocks as they are added to the ledger. // keep the block_reg to unregister with later if needed block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received the block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; }, (error)=&gt; { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; }); The following example will register with a start block number because this application needs to resume at a specific block and replay the missed blocks. The application callback will handle the replayed blocks in the same manor like current events. The block listener will continue to receive blocks as they are committed to the ledger on the peer. // keep the block_reg to unregister with later if needed block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received the block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; }, (error)=&gt; { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; }, {startBlock:23} ); The following example will register with a start block number and an end block. The application needs to replay the missed blocks. The application callback will handle the replayed blocks in the same manor as current events. The block listener will be automatically unregistered and the ChannelEventHub shutdown when the end block event is seen by the listener. The application will not have to handle this housekeeping. block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received a block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; const event_block = Long.fromValue(block.header.number); if(event_block.equals(current_block)) { console.log('Successfully got the last block number'); &lt;application is now up to date&gt; } }, (error)=&gt; { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; }, // for block listeners, the defaults for unregister and disconnect are true, // so they are not required to be set in the following example {startBlock:23, endBlock:30, unregister: true, disconnect: true} ); channel_event_hub.connect({full_block: true}); //get full blocks and no connect callback The following example will register with a start block number and an end block set to 'newest'. The error callback will be called to notify the application that the last block has been delivered and that the listener has been shutdown. block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received the block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; }, (error)=&gt; { if(error.toString().indexOf('Newest block received')) { console.log('Received latest block'); &lt;application is now up to date&gt; } else { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; } }, {startBlock:23, endBlock:'newest'} ); Transaction listener When there is a need to monitor for the completion of a transaction on your organization's peer, use a transaction listener. The client Node.js will be notified when a new block is committed to the ledger on the peer. The client will then check the block for registered transaction identifiers. If a transaction is found then the callback will be notified with the transaction ID, the transaction status, and the block number. Filtered blocks contain the transaction status, so there is no need to connect to the peer's channel-based event service to receive full blocks. Since most non-admin users will not be able to see full blocks, connecting to receive filtered blocks will avoid access issues when those users only need to listen for their transactions to be committed. The following example will show registering a transaction ID within a javascript promise and building another promise for sending the transaction to the orderer. Both promises will be executed together so that the results will be received for both actions together. The default optional setting of unregister is true with a transaction listener. Therefore in the following example the listener that is registered will be automatically unregistered after the listener sees the transaction. let tx_object = client.newTransactionID(); // get the transaction ID string for later use let tx_id = tx_object.getTransactionID(); let request = { targets : targets, chaincodeId: 'my_chaincode', fcn: 'invoke', args: ['doSomething', 'with this data'], txId: tx_object }; return channel.sendTransactionProposal(request); }).then((results) =&gt; { // a real application would check the proposal results console.log('Successfully endorsed proposal to invoke chaincode'); // start block may be null if there is no need to resume or replay let start_block = getBlockFromSomewhere(); let event_monitor = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { let handle = setTimeout(() =&gt; { // do the housekeeping when there is a problem channel_event_hub.unregisterTxEvent(tx_id); console.log('Timeout - Failed to receive the transaction event'); reject(new Error('Timed out waiting for block event')); }, 20000); channel_event_hub.registerTxEvent((event_tx_id, status, block_num) =&gt; { clearTimeout(handle); //channel_event_hub.unregisterTxEvent(event_tx_id); let the default do this console.log('Successfully received the transaction event'); storeBlockNumForLater(block_num); resolve(status); }, (error)=&gt; { clearTimeout(handle); console.log('Failed to receive the transaction event ::'+error); reject(error); }, // when this `startBlock` is null (the normal case) transaction // checking will start with the latest block {startBlock:start_block} // notice that `unregister` is not specified, so it will default to true // `disconnect` is also not specified and will default to false ); channel_event_hub.connect(); }); let send_trans = channel.sendTransaction({proposalResponses: results[0], proposal: results[1]}); return Promise.all([event_monitor, send_trans]); }).then((results) =&gt; { Chaincode event listener When there is a need to monitor for events that will be posted from within your chaincode, use a chaincode event listener. The client Node.js will be notified when a new block is committed to the ledger. The client will then check for registered chaincode patterns within the chaincode event's name field. The registration of the listener includes a regular expression to be used in the check against a chaincode event name. If a chaincode event name is found to match the listener's regular expression then the listener's callback will be notified with the chaincode event, the block number, transaction id, and transaction status. Filtered blocks will not have the chaincode event payload information; it has only the chaincode event name. If the payload information is required, the user must have access to the full block and the channel event hub must be connect(true) to receive the full block events from the peer's channel-based event service. The following example demonstrates registering a chaincode event listener within a javascript promise and building another promise for sending the transaction to the orderer. Both promises will be executed together so that the results will be received for both actions together. If a chaincode event listener is needed for long term monitoring, follow the block listener example above. let tx_object = client.newTransactionID(); let request = { targets : targets, chaincodeId: 'my_chaincode', fcn: 'invoke', args: ['doSomething', 'with this data'], txId: tx_object }; return channel.sendTransactionProposal(request); }).then((results) =&gt; { // a real application would check the proposal results console.log('Successfully endorsed proposal to invoke chaincode'); // Build the promise to register a event listener with the NodeSDK. // The NodeSDK will then send a request to the peer's channel-based event // service to start sending blocks. The blocks will be inspected to see if // there is a match with a chaincode event listener. let event_monitor = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { let regid = null; let handle = setTimeout(() =&gt; { if (regid) { // might need to do the clean up this listener channel_event_hub.unregisterChaincodeEvent(regid); console.log('Timeout - Failed to receive the chaincode event'); } reject(new Error('Timed out waiting for chaincode event')); }, 20000); regid = channel_event_hub.registerChaincodeEvent(chaincode_id.toString(), '^evtsender*', (event, block_num, txnid, status) =&gt; { // This callback will be called when there is a chaincode event name // within a block that will match on the second parameter in the registration // from the chaincode with the ID of the first parameter. console.log('Successfully got a chaincode event with transid:'+ txnid + ' with status:'+status); // might be good to store the block number to be able to resume if offline storeBlockNumForLater(block_num); // to see the event payload, the channel_event_hub must be connected(true) let event_payload = event.payload.toString('utf8'); if(event_payload.indexOf('CHAINCODE') &gt; -1) { clearTimeout(handle); // Chaincode event listeners are meant to run continuously // Therefore the default to automatically unregister is false // So in this case we want to shutdown the event listener once // we see the event with the correct payload channel_event_hub.unregisterChaincodeEvent(regid); console.log('Successfully received the chaincode event on block number '+ block_num); resolve('RECEIVED'); } else { console.log('Successfully got chaincode event ... just not the one we are looking for on block number '+ block_num); } }, (error)=&gt; { clearTimeout(handle); console.log('Failed to receive the chaincode event ::'+error); reject(error); } // no options specified // unregister will default to false // disconnect will default to false ); }); // build the promise to send the proposals to the orderer let send_trans = channel.sendTransaction({proposalResponses: results[0], proposal: results[1]}); // now that we have two promises all set to go... execute them return Promise.all([event_monitor, send_trans]); }).then((results) =&gt; { The default is to receive the chaincode events one at a time, however it would be difficult to know that a chaincode event was missed and to maintain the order within the block. Using the new option as_array the callback will receive all chaincode events found in a block as an array. The following example will register a chaincode listener with a callback that will handle the chaincodes as an array, notice the fifth parameter is an options object with the 'as_array' true setting. channel_event_hub.registerChaincodeEvent( 'mychaincode', 'myeventname', (...events) =&gt; { for (const {chaincode_event, block_num, tx_id, tx_status} of events) { /* process each event */ } }, (err) =&gt;{ /* process err */ }, { as_array: true} ); When using mutual tls All peers and orderers objects need to use the same client side credentials for a mutual TLS connection. The credentials must be assigned to the 'client' object instance before it is used to create the peer used in the ChannelEventHub creation. const client = new Client(); client.setTlsClientCertAndKey(tlsInfo.certificate, tlsInfo.key); const channel = client.newChannel('mychannel'); const peer = client.newPeer('grpcs://localhost:7051', { pem: '&lt;pem string here&gt;', 'ssl-target-name-override': 'peer0.org1.example.com' }); channel.addPeer(peer); const channelEventHub = channel.newChannelEventHub(peer); When connecting to replay Your application may be recording the block numbers as they come in or it may use the last block of another channel event hub. Your application has been off line and now wishes to catch up on the missed blocks and then continue to process new blocks. The following will connect a channel event hub to the Peer's channel-based event service at the point of your choice and since there is no endBlock specified, it will continue to receive the blocks as they are added to the ledger. Note: Use the ChannelEventHubs.lastBlockNumber() to get the number of the last block received from a previously running ChannelEventHub instance. const channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub(mypeer); // be sure to register your listeners before calling `connect` or you may // miss an event channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent(eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) const my_starting_point = this._calculate_starting_point(old_event_hub); channel_event_hub.connect({startBlock: my_starting_point}, my_connect_call_back); When reconnecting Your application has a long running block listener or chaincode event listener and you wish to restart the event listening. The following will reconnect the channel event hub to the Peer's channel-based event service and not disturb the existing event listeners. The connection will be setup to start sending blocks from the last block the channel event hub had seen. The listeners may be notified by a block or event that has already been seen and this may be used to verify that notifications are again running. channel_event_hub.reconnect({startBlock: 'last_seen'}, my_connect_call_back); This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

For more information on: Service Discovery The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript promise and async await. Overview The service discovery provided by the Hyperledger Fabric helps an application understand the current view of the network. Service discovery also has insight into the endorsement policies of chaincodes and is able to provide lists of peers that are currently active on the network that could be used to endorse a proposal. To use the discovery service, the application will have to define just one peer. fabric-network APIs that can use the service discovery gateway.connect - This method has been enhanced by adding the discovery options. gateway.getNetwork - This method will initialize the network channel using the discovery options from the gateway connect. contract.addDiscoveryInterest - This method will add collections and/or additional chaincodes and collections to the discovery interests to be used by the peer's discovery service when building an endorsement plan. This allows the plan to be built based on the policy information of the contract's chaincodes and collections. contract.submitTransaction - When discovery is enabled by the gateway.connect options, this method will use discovery to help endorse the proposal. transaction.submit - - When discovery is enabled by the gateway.connect options, this method will use discovery to help endorse the proposal. contract.evaluateTransaction - When discovery is enabled by the gateway.connect options, this method will select from the peers that have been discovered during the network channel initialization. transaction.evaluate - When discovery is enabled by the gateway.connect options, this method will select from the peers that have been discovered during the network channel initialization. fabric-network gateway.connect DiscoveryOption settings discovery.enabled - boolean - True if discovery should be used; otherwise false. discovery.asLocalhost - boolean - Convert discovered host addresses to be 'localhost'. Will be needed when running a docker composed fabric network on the local system; otherwise should be disabled. To use By default the fabric-network will use the service discovery. To enable the use of discovery, set the discovery 'enabled' attribute to a value of true. The default is true. await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, {discovery: { enabled: true, asLocalhost: false}}); const network = await gateway.getNetork('mychannel'); To use with docker-compose When the fabric network is running in a docker-compose and the node.js application is running outside of the docker containers, it will be necessary to modify the addresses returned from the discovery service. The discovery service sees the addresses of the peers and orderers as host names and ports as they exist in the virtual systems, however the node.js application running outside of docker will only know the endpoints as localhost and port. In the docker-compose file, notice how Docker is mapping the port addresses, these must be same when using service discovery. Using - 7061:7051 will not work as the application does not have visibility into the virtual system and the port address as seen by the peer's discovery service. Use the asLocalhost with true or false, the default is false. await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, {discovery: { enabled: true, asLocalhost: true}}); const network = await gateway.getNetork('mychannel'); Notice in the following definition of a peer from a docker-compose file. The port number is the same and has been defined along with the host name peer0.org1.example.com:7051 for the peer and gossip settings. The node.js fabric-client application running outside of of the docker containers will use localhost:7051. There is a mapping of the host name to 'localhost' but there is no mapping of the port address. peer0.org1.example.com: container_name: peer0.org1.example.com image: hyperledger/fabric-peer environment: - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock - CORE_PEER_ID=peer0.org1.example.com - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_LISTENADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug ## the following setting redirects chaincode container logs to the peer container logs - CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true - CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP - CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer ## - CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=true - CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/tls/key.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/tls/cert.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS_FILES=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem # # the following setting starts chaincode containers on the same # # bridge network as the peers # # https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/ - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=fixtures_default working_dir: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric command: peer node start ports: - 7051:7051 volumes: - /var/run/:/host/var/run/ - ./channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/:/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer depends_on: - orderer.example.com using chaincode to chaincode calls and collections The peer's discovery service will required information on the channel, chaincodes, and collections that are involved in the smart contract to develop a valid endorsement plan. The contract's channel name and chaincode name will be automatically sent to the peer's discovery service unless the contract indicates that it requires other chaincodes and collections. These are known as 'discovery interests' to the peer's discovery service. If the endorsement will require one or more chaincode to chaincode calls and/or be over collections, then the application must tell the contract object instance of these names. This will assist the discovery service in putting together an endorsement plan based on all the endorsement policies of the chaincodes and collections involved and the active peers on the network. The endorsement plan will include those peers that satisfy the endorsement policies and the collection policies. The following examples show how to add to the discovery interests when the chaincode is in one or more collections or the chaincode is calling other chaincodes. // --------- example 1 -------------------------------------------- // when the smart contract's chaincode will be calling another chaincode const contract = network.getContract('mychaincode1'); // this adds to the interests contract.addDiscoveryInterest({name: 'mychaincode2'}); // produces discovery interests of: [ {name: 'mychaincode1'}, {name: 'mychaincode2'} ] // --------- example 2 -------------------------------------------- // when the smart contract's chaincode is in a collection const contract = network.getContract('mychaincode1'); // this adds the collection name to the contract's chaincode interest contract.addDiscoveryInterest({name: 'mychaincode1', collectionNames: ['mycollection1']}); // produces discovery interests of: [ {name: 'mychaincode1', collectionNames: ['mycollection1']} ] // --------- example 3 -------------------------------------------- // when the smart contract's chaincode is in multiple collections // and will be calling another chaincode that is in // multiple collections const contract = network.getContract('mychaincode1'); // this adds the collection names to the contract's chaincode interest contract.addDiscoveryInterest({name: 'mychaincode1', collectionNames: ['mycollection1', 'mycollection2']}); // this adds to the interests contract.addDiscoveryInterest({name: 'mychaincode2', collectionNames: ['mycollection1', 'mycollection2']}); // produces discovery interests of: [ {name: 'mychaincode1', collectionNames: ['mycollection1', 'mycollection2']}, {name: 'mychaincode2', collectionNames: ['mycollection1', 'mycollection2']} ] This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration Service Discovery The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript promise and async await. Overview The service discovery provided by the Hyperledger Fabric helps an application to understand the current view of the network. The service discovery also has insight into the endorsement policy of chaincodes and is able to provide various list of peers that are currently active on the network that could be used to endorse a proposal. To use the service the application will have to connect with just one peer. Modified API's that will use the service discovery channel.initialize() - This method has been enhanced by adding an option to query a peer using the new service discovery to initialize the channel object. This method may be call at anytime to reinitialize the channel. When using discovery, this may be used to assign a new target peer providing the discovery service. The initialize() method is also required to instantiate the handlers, by default the handlers shipped with the fabric-client are designed to use the discovery results. channel.sendTransactionProposal() - This method has been enhanced to use the discovered peers to send the endorsement proposal. channel.sendTransaction() - This method has been enhanced to use the discovered orderers to send the signed endorsements. New API's that will use service discovery channel.refresh() - The channel will be refreshed with new service discovery results, add new peers, orderers, and MSPs. The call will use the service discovery settings as provided on the channel.initialize() call. If a new peer is required for the refresh of discovery results then call the channel.initialize() with a new target peer rather then calling refresh(). channel.getDiscoveryResults() - The channel will cache the results of the last query made to the service discovery and make the results available. The call will use the discovery-cache-life setting to determine if the results should be refreshed. if the results need to be refreshed, the channel.refresh() will be called internally to fetch new service discovery results. The call is used by the DiscoveryEndorsementHandler as it starts to determine the target peers. client.queryPeers() - A client object will be able to query a target peer using the discovery service to provide a list of peer endpoints and associated organizations active on the network at the time of the query. see Client#queryPeers New configuration settings initialize-with-discovery - boolean - When the applications calls for the channel to be initialized, service discovery will be used. (default false) discovery-cache-life - integer (time in milliseconds) - The amount of time the service discovery results are considered valid. (default 300000 - 5 minutes) override-discovery-protocol - string - Override the protocol to use when building URL's for the discovered endpoints. The Discovery Service only provides host:port. By default, if you connect to the Discovery Service without TLS (grpc://), then all discovered endpoints will be connected to without TLS. If you connect to the Discovery Service with TLS (grpcs://), then all discovered endpoints will be connected to with TLS. You can use this configuration setting to force either grpc or grpcs for all discovered endpoints, regardless of how you connected to the Discovery Service. Please note that it is highly recommended not to connect to the Discovery Service or any discovered endpoints without TLS (grpc://), as all information will be sent over plaintext, un-encrypted. endorsement-handler - string - The path to the endorsement handler. Allows for a custom handler to be used. This handler is used in the sendTransactionProposal method to determine the target peers and how to send the proposal. (default 'fabric-client/lib/impl/DiscoveryEndorsementHandler.js') commit-handler - string - The path to the commit handler. Allows for a custom handler to be used. This handler is used in the sendTransaction method to determine the orderers and how to send the transaction to be committed. (default 'fabric-client/lib/impl/BasicCommitHandler.js') How the DiscoveryEndorsementHandler works The sendTransactionProposal will use the peers included in the \"targets\" to endorse the proposal. If there is no \"targets\" parameter, the endorsement request will be handled by the endorsement handler. The default handler that comes with the fabric-client is designed to use the results from the fabric discovery service. The peer that is assigned as the target during channel initialization will be the peer that is sent the discovery service request. The discovery service results will be based on the chaincode of the endorsement or based on an endorsement hint (endorsementHint) included in the endorsement request. The hint may include one or more chaincodes and each chaincode may include one or more associated collection names. Results will be refreshed using the discovery-cache-life system setting. By default the cache life is 5 minutes. This may be changed easily by using the following. Client.setConfigSetting('discover-cache-life', &lt;milliseconds&gt;); If there are no service discovery results, the handler will send the endorsement request to the peers that have been assigned to the channel with the endorsingPeer role (a peer that has nor been assigned a role will default to having that role, this means that a role must be explicitly turned off). When the handler processes the discovery service results it assumes that all peers referenced have a peer instance object created and assigned to the channel instance object. The channel instance will build the required peer instances to support endorsements when it processes the discovery service results before passing the results to the handler. The channel will not build new peer instances if the peer is already assigned to the channel either by the application or by a previous discovery service request. The default 'DiscoveryEndorsementHandler' takes optional parameters that allow the application to specify peers or organizations that will be preferred, ignored or required. The discovery service results will include groups of peers and layouts that specify how many peers from each group it will take to satisfy the endorsement policy of the proposal's chaincode or the endorsement policies of the endorsement hint. Each group will be modified using the parameters of the endorsement call. The handler will first remove peers that are not required or should be ignored. Then the group list will be sorted by ledger height or randomized. Finally preferred peers will be moved to the top of the group list. The handler will randomly select a layout to make the endorsement. The handler looks at each group in the layout and selects the number peers specified by that group in the layout. The number of peers is the number of endorsements needed to satisfy the endorsement policy. Peers will be selected starting at the top of the modified group list to be sent an endorsement request. If any of the requests fail, the handler will select the next available peer from the modified group list. If the number of successful endorsements reaches the number of peers called out for each group in the layout, the handler will successfully return the endorsements. If there are not enough successful endorsements, the handler will select another random layout and try again or return an error indicating that it was unable to complete successfully. The error will include the responses from all peers. Note: The default handler does not remember the results of the previous call. Peers that may have failed will be tried again. With randomizing and refreshing of the discovery service results, the order of how peers are selected will likely change on every request. Note: If the above behavior does not meet the needs of your organization a custom handler may be used. How the BasicCommitHandler works The default handler that comes with the fabric-client will send to one orderer at a time until it receives a successful submission of the transaction. Sending a transaction (a set of endorsements) to an orderer does not mean that the transaction will be committed, it means that the request was built properly and that the sender has the authority to send the request. The response from the orderer will indicate that the orderer has accepted the request. The sendTransaction has an optional parameter orderer that indicates the orderer to send the transaction. The handler will use the orderer as specified with the orderer parameter and not send to any other orderers. If no orderer is specified the handler will get the list of orderers assigned to the channel. These orderers may have been assigned manually to the channel with a channel.addOrderer() call or assigned automatically when using the service discovery. To Initialize By default the fabric-client will not use the service discovery. To enable the use of the service, set the config setting to true or use the discover parameter on the initialize() call. note: Channel#initialize must be run to both enable discovery and to startup the handlers. Client.setConfigSetting('initialize-with-discovery', true); --or-- Client.addConfigFile('/path/to/config.json'); // the json file contains the following line //\"initialize-with-discovery\": true //--or-- await channel.initialize({discover:true}); To use the service discovery on the initialize(), a channel must have at least one peer assigned with the discovery role or a target must be provided on the call. Peers may be assigned automatically by loading a connection profile or they may have been added manually with the channel.addPeer(). await channel.initialize({ discover: true, target: peer }); //--or-- await channel.initialize({ discover: true, target: 'peer2.org2.example.com' //peer defined in the connection profile }); //--or-- // no target specified, using the first peer with the discover role // peer was added to the channel either by the 'addPeer' or when using // a connection profile await channel.initialize({ discover: true }); The return results of initialization with service discovery will be the MSP configurations, the peers, the orderers, and the endorsing plans for all chaincodes on the channel in JSON format. The results are stored and cached internally and the caller does not have to do anything with the results, they are provided only for reference. The initialize call also allows for changing the endorsement handler by specifying a path to a custom endorsement handler. The handler may be changed independently of using the service discovery. The default endorsement handler however does use discovery service results to determine the endorsing peers. await channel.initialize({ endorsementHandler: '/path/to/my/handler.js' }); When the fabric network is running in a docker-compose and the node.js application is running outside of the docker containers, it will be necessary to modify the addresses returned from the service discovery. The service discovery sees the addresses of the peers and orderers as host names and ports, however the node.js application running outside of docker will only know the endpoints as localhost and port. In the docker-compose file, notice how Docker is mapping the port addresses, these must be same when using service discovery. Using - 7061:7051 will not work as the fabric-client does not have visibility into the docker-compose file. Notice in the following definition of a peer from a docker-compose file. The port number is the same and has been defined along with the host name peer0.org1.example.com:7051 for the peer and gossip settings. The node.js fabric-client application running outside of of the docker containers will use localhost:7051. peer0.org1.example.com: container_name: peer0.org1.example.com image: hyperledger/fabric-peer environment: - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock - CORE_PEER_ID=peer0.org1.example.com - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_LISTENADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug ## the following setting redirects chaincode container logs to the peer container logs - CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true - CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP - CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer ## - CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=true - CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/tls/key.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/tls/cert.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS_FILES=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem # # the following setting starts chaincode containers on the same # # bridge network as the peers # # https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/ - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=fixtures_default working_dir: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric command: peer node start ports: - 7051:7051 volumes: - /var/run/:/host/var/run/ - ./channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/:/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer depends_on: - orderer.example.com The channel.initialize() call as new parameter to indicate that the hostname mapping to localhost should be done. Use the asLocalhost with true or false, the default is false. await channel.initialize({discover:true, asLocalhost:true}) Using peers added manually to the channel: Only one peer will now be required to be added to the channel when the applications programmatically adds the peers and orderers to build a channel instance. The peer must have the role discover. As with all roles, if the role is not defined and set to false, the peer will have that role on the channel by default. const channel = client.newChannel('mychannel'); const peer = client.newPeer(....); channel.addPeer(peer); await channel.initialize({discover:true}); When the channel is initialized using service discovery and peers and orderers are added to the channel, a peer with the address that was used for service discovery will likely be on the list of discovered peers. A peer with the address used for service discovery will not be added again to the channel as a peer with that address has already been assigned to the channel. The name a peer will be known by may be set by using the name setting when creating the peer. const peer = client.newPeer(url, {name: 'peer0', ...}); The default name of a peer will be the host name and port if the name parameter is not provided or for peers added by service discovery. peer0.org1.example.com:7051 Using a peer not added to the channel: To use the service discovery a peer is required. The application may define a peer and pass it on the initialize call. The peer does not have to be added to the channel instance. const channel = client.newChannel('mychannel'); const peer = client.newPeer(....); await channel.initialize({discover:true, target:peer}); When the channel is initialized using service discovery and peers and orderers are added to the channel, a peer with the address that was used for service discovery will likely be on the list of discovered peers. A peer instance with the address used for service discovery will be added to the channel with the same address as the peer instance used for service discovery because the peer instance used on the initialize call is not added to the channel, it is only used on the initialize call. If the application chooses to use no longer use the peer on the initialize call or the peer that was automatically assigned call the channel.initialize() again and provide a peer instance or name. This new peer will be used going forward for service discovery calls. Using connection profile: When using a connection profile, all the peers and orderers on the network will no longer need to be provided. Just one peer will be required and assigned to the channel. The peer must have the role discover. As with all roles, if the role is not defined and set to false, the peer will have that role on the channel by default. The following example shows a peer that is going to be used primarily for service discovery. channels: mychannel: peers: peer1.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: false chaincodeQuery: false ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false discover: true peer2.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: true ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false discover: false peers: peer1.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer1.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/c... peer2.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8052 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer2.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/c... When a channel is created using the client.getChannel() after the client instance has loaded a connection profile, the fabric-client will create peers and assign them to the channel. The peers and orderers will inherent the connection options as assigned to the client instance. see Client#addConnectionOptions Peers with the the discover role will be used when the channel.initialize() is called and no peer is passed as a target. const client = Client.loadFromConfig(...); const channel = client.getChannel('mychannel'); await channel.initialize({discover:true, asLocalhost:true}; If the initialize fails because the peer with the discover role is not online, the application may select another peer. await channel.initialize({discover:true, target:'peer2.org2.example.com'}); When the application passes a peer name or a peer instance to the initialize call, that peer will be used and the discover role will not be checked. The name a peer will be known by is the name used in the yaml file. peer1.org2.example.com:port The name of a peer will be the host name and port for peers added by the service discovery. peer0.org1.example.com:7051 To Endorse As discussed above, the channel.sendTransactionProposal() will now use a pluggable handler. The fabric-client will come with a handler that will use service discovery. By default the endorsement-handler configuration setting will point to the DiscoveryEndorsementHandler. If the channel has been initialized using the service discovery and there are no targets define on the sendTransactionProposal call, the handler will use the service discovery results based on the chaincode of the proposal request to determine the target peers to perform the endorsements. const tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); const request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id }; await channel.sendTransactionProposal(request); If the endorsement will require one or more chaincode to chaincode calls and/or be over a collection or two, then the endorsement proposal request must include the parameter \"endorsement_hint\". This will assist the discovery service in putting together an endorsement plan based on all the endorsement policies of chaincodes and collections involved and the active peers on the network. The following example shows a chaincode to chaincode call over collections. Notice how the chaincode that starts the endorsement must also still be included as the \"chaincodeId\" of the endorsement request. const hint = { chaincodes: [ { name: \"my_chaincode1\", collection_names: [\"my_collection1\", \"my_collection2\"] }, { name: \"my_chaincode2\", collection_names: [\"my_collection1\", \"my_collection2\"] } ]}; const tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); const request = { chaincodeId : 'my_chaincode1', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id, endorsement_hint: hint }; await channel.sendTransactionProposal(request); The application is able to have specific peers or peers in a specified organization chosen before other peers or not be chosen at all for endorsements. required: An array of strings that represent the names of peers. Peers named on this list and in the endorsement plan will be the only peers to be sent the endorsement request. Other peers found in the endorsement plan will not be used. preferred: An array of strings that represent the names of peers that should be given priority by the endorsement handler if their ledger height is up to date. ignored: An array of strings that represent the names of peers that should be ignored by the endorsement handler. requiredOrgs: An array of strings that represent the names of organizations. Peers found in the endorsement plan that are in these organizations will be the only peers to be sent the endorsement request. Other peers found in the endorsement plan will not be used. preferredOrgs: An array of strings that represent the MSP ids of organizations that should be given priority by the endorsement handler if their ledger height is up to date. ignoredOrgs: An array of strings that represent the MSP ids of organizations that should be ignored by the endorsement handler. preferredHeightGap: An integer representing the maximum difference in the ledger height of a peer and the highest ledger height found in a group of peers. A peer will be given priority if it's ledger height is within this range. There is no default, if this value is not provided the ledger height of the peer will not be considered when being added a peer to the preferred list. sort: A string value that indicates how the peers within groups should be chosen. There are two sorts available: \"ledgerHeight\", sort the peers descending by the number of blocks on the channel ledger. \"random\", sort the peers randomly from the list, the preferred peers will be added randomly first then the others will be added randomly. The default is to sort by ledger height. For example when the handler gets the following request and has an endorsement plan with 'peer3' ledger height of 2000 and 'peer1' ledger height of 1990. Notice that the gap is 10, this gap is too large and 'peer1' will not be given priority. const request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id, preferred: ['peer0', 'peer1.org1.example.com:8051'], preferredHeightGap: 5, ignored: ['peer1', 'peer2.org2.example.com:8054'] } For example when the handler gets the following request and has an endorsement plan with 'peer3' in 'Org3MSP' ledger height of 2000 and 'peer1' in 'Org1MSP' ledger height of 1990. Notice that the difference is 10, this gap is too large and 'peer1' will not be given priority. const request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id, preferredOrgs: ['Org1MSP', 'Org3MSP'], preferredHeightGap: 5, ignored: ['Org4MSP'] } When the application only knows about organizations and will not know about specific peers it may use the 'requiredOrgs', 'preferredOrgs', and/or 'ignoredOrgs' request parameters. For example if the application knows that the transaction is between two organizations, it may require that only these two endorse the proposal. const request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id, requiredOrgs: ['Org2MSP', 'Org3MSP'] } To Commit As discussed above, the channel.sendTransaction() will now use a pluggable handler. The fabric-client will come with a handler that will use all orderers added to the channel. By default the commit-handler configuration setting will point to the BasicCommitHandler. This handler will send the transaction to each orderer, one at a time, that has been assigned to the channel until it gets a SUCCESS response or until the list is exhausted. The orderers may been added manually, due to a service discovery initialization or combination of the two. If an orderer is specified on the call, only that orderer will be used.

Overview Events are emitted by peers when blocks are committed. Two types of events support checkpointing: Contract events (also known as chaincode events) - Defined in transactions to be emitted. E.g. an event emitted when a commercial paper is sold Block Events - Emitted when a block is committed In the case of an application crashing and events being missed, applications may still want to execute the event callback for the event it missed. Peers in a Fabric network support event replay, and to support this, the fabric-network module supports checkpointing strategies that track the last block and transactions in that block, that have been seen by the client. Disclaimer Checkpointing in its current form has not been tested to deal with all recovery scenarios, so it should be used alongside existing recovery infrastructure. module:fabric-network~FileSystemCheckpointer is designed for Proof of Technology projects, so we strongly suggest implementing your own checkpointer using the module:fabric-network~BaseCheckpointer interface. Notes Block Number = Block Height - 1 When using checkpointing: The listener will only catch up on events if the startBlock is less than the current Block Number If the latest block in the checkpointer is block n the startBlock will be n + 1 (e.g. for checkpoint blockNumber=1,startBlock=2) Checkpointers The BaseCheckpoint class is an interface that is to be used by all Checkpoint classes. fabric-network has one default class, module:fabric-network~FileSystemCheckpointer that is exported as a factory in the module:fabric-network~CheckpointFactories. The FILE_SYSTEM_CHECKPOINTER is the default checkpointer. A checkpoint factory is a function that returns an instance with BaseCheckpointer as a parent class. These classes implement the async save(channelName, listenerName) and async load() functions. BaseCheckpointer.save() is called after the async callback function given to the event listener has finished processing. Custom Checkpointer Configuring a custom checkpointer requires two components to be created: The Checkpointer class The Factory const fs = require('fs-extra'); const path = require('path'); const { Gateway } = require('fabric-network'); class FileSystemCheckpointer extends BaseCheckpointer { constructor(channelName, listenerName, fsOptions) { super(channelName, listenerName); this.basePath = path.resolve(fsOptions.basePath); this.channelName = channelName; this.listenerName = listenerName; } /** * Initializes the checkpointer directory structure */ async _initialize() { const cpPath = this._getCheckpointFileName() } /** * Constructs the checkpoint files name */ _getCheckpointFileName() { let filePath = path.join(this._basePath, this._channelName); if (this._chaincodeId) { filePath = path.join(filePath, this._chaincodeId); } return path.join(filePath, this._listenerName); } async save(transactionId, blockNumber) { const cpPath = this._getCheckpointFileName() if (!(await fs.exists(cpPath))) { await this._initialize(); } const latestCheckpoint = await this.load(); if (Number(latestCheckpoint.blockNumber) === Number(blockNumber)) { const transactionIds = latestCheckpoint.transactionIds; latestCheckpoint.transactionIds = transactionIds; } else { latestCheckpoint.blockNumber = blockNumber; latestCheckpoint.transactionIds = [transactionIds]; } await fs.writeFile(cppPath, JSON.stringify(latestCheckpoint)); } async load() { const cpPath = this._getCheckpointFileName(this._chaincodeId); if (!(await fs.exists(cpPath))) { await this._initialize(); } const chkptBuffer = await fs.readFile(cpFile); let checkpoint = checkpointBuffer.toString('utf8'); if (!checkpoint) { checkpoint = {}; } else { checkpoint = JSON.parse(checkpoint); } return checkpoint; } } function File_SYSTEM_CHECKPOINTER_FACTORY(channelName, listenerName, options) { return new FileSystemCheckpointer(channelName, listenerName, options); } const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect({ checkpointer: { factory: FILE_SYSTEM_CHECKPOINTER_FACTORY, options: {basePath: '/home/blockchain/checkpoints'} // These options will vary depending on the checkpointer implementation }); In addition to save() and load() the BaseCheckpointer interface also has the loadLatestCheckpoint() function which, in the case that load() returns a list of checkpoints, will return the latest incomplete checkpoint (or whichever is most relevant for the specific implementation). Note: When using the filesystem checkpointer, use absolute paths rather than relative paths. When specifying a specific type of checkpointer for a listener, the checkpointer option in module:fabric-network.Network~EventListenerOptions`. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

The ChannelEventHub is a fabric-client class that receives contract, commit and block events from the event hub within a peer. The fabric-network abstracts the event hub away, and instead uses an event hub selection strategy to create new event hub instances or reuse existing instances. Below is an example event hub selection strategy: class ExampleEventHubSelectionStrategy extends AbstractEventHubSelectionStrategy { constructor(peers) { this.peers = peers; this.disconnectedPeers = []; this.cleanupInterval = null; } _disconnectedPeerCleanup() { this.cleanupInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; { // Reset the list of disconnected peers every 10 seconds for (const peerRecord of disconnectedPeers) { // If 10 seconds has passed since the disconnect if (Date.now() - peerRecord.time &gt; 10000) { this.disconnectedPeers = this.disconnectedPeers.filter((p) =&gt; p !== peerRecord.peer); } } if (this.disconnectedPeers.length === 0) { clearInterval(this.cleanupInterval); this.cleanupInterval = null; } }, 10000); } /** * Returns the next peer in the list per the strategy implementation * @returns {ChannelPeer} */ getNextPeer() { // Only select those peers that have not been disconnected recently let availablePeers = this.peers.filter((peer) =&gt; this.disconnectedPeers.indexOf(peer) === -1) if (availablePeers.length === 0) { availablePeers = this.peers; } const randomPeerIdx = Math.floor(Math.random() * availablePeers.length); return availablePeers[randomPeerIdx]; } /** * Updates the status of a peers event hub * @param {ChannelPeer} deadPeer The peer that needs its status updating */ updateEventHubAvailability(deadPeer) { if (!this.cleanupInterval) { this._disconnectedPeerCleanup() } this.disconnectedPeers.push({peer: deadPeer, time: Date.now()}) } } The event hub strategy exists at a gateway level, and is included in the GatewayOptions in the form of a factory function. The factory gives the event hub selection strategy instance a list of peers that it can select event hubs from. function EXAMPLE_EVENT_HUB_SELECTION_FACTORY(network) { const orgPeers = getOrganizationPeers(network); const eventEmittingPeers = filterEventEmittingPeers(orgPeers); return new ExampleEventHubSelectionStrategy(eventEmittingPeers); } const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, { ... eventHubSelectionOptions: { strategy: EXAMPLE_EVENT_HUB_SELECTION_FACTORY } }) Static event hub Calling module:fabric-network.AbstractEventListener#setEventHub allows you to set one event hub that will not change.

For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development. Overview The Hyperledger Fabric Node.js javascript SDK, fabric-client, communicates with a Hyperledger Fabric network using gRPC. The gRPC technology, framework, handles moving data reliably between the fabric network and the fabric client application. fabric-client allows the application to provide settings required to control the environment. fabric-client has default connection options that include default gRPC settings. There are various ways for the application to override the default connection options. Default connection options fabric-client has the following gRPC connection options as defaults. These are in the default.json system configuration file that is included with the fabric-client NPM package. \"connection-options\": { \"grpc.max_receive_message_length\": -1, \"grpc.max_send_message_length\": -1, \"grpc.keepalive_time_ms\": 120000, \"grpc.http2.min_time_between_pings_ms\": 120000, \"grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms\": 20000, \"grpc.http2.max_pings_without_data\": 0, \"grpc.keepalive_permit_without_calls\": 1 } grpc.max_receive_message_length - Maximum message length that the channel can receive. Int valued, bytes. -1 means unlimited. grpc.max_send_message_length - Maximum message length that the channel can send. Int valued, bytes. -1 means unlimited. grpc.keepalive_time_ms - After a duration of this time the client/server pings its peer to see if the transport is still alive. Int valued, milliseconds. grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms - After waiting for a duration of this time, if the keepalive ping sender does not receive the ping ack, it will close the transport. Int valued, milliseconds. grpc.keepalive_permit_without_calls - Is it permissible to send keepalive pings without any outstanding streams. Int valued, 0(false)/1(true). grpc.http2.min_time_between_pings_ms - Minimum time between sending successive ping frames without receiving any data frame. Int valued, milliseconds. grpc.http2.max_pings_without_data - Minimum allowed time between a server receiving successive ping frames without sending any data frame. Int valued, milliseconds. Change default connection options The application may have a need to change or add new gRPC settings. By using the system configuration, the application may change the default connection options used for all new connections established. The default connection options are retrieved as a set of options when the Client instance builds new Peers or new Orderers. To modify the default connection options before runtime, update the default.json file or add your own configuration file to the system configuration. The last file loaded will override all previous files including the default.json file shipped with the fabric-client. see BaseClient.addConfigFile. const Client = require('fabric-client'); Client.addConfigFile(&lt;path to the config file&gt;); To modify the default connection options during runtime, get them from the system configuration, make modifications, then set them back on the system configuration. const default_options = client.getConfigSetting('connection-options'); const new_option = { 'grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms': 10000 }; // use the assign call to keep all other options and only update // the one setting or add a setting. const new_defaults = Object.assign(default_options, new_option); client.setConfigSetting('connection-options', new_defaults); // peer will have default options const peer = client.newPeer(url, options); Note: Making a change to the system configuration will have all new connections use new default connection options. This includes the connections that are created by new peers and new orderers that are created automatically when using the discovery service. Be careful when assigning new values to not remove other values. All the default connection options are contained in the one system configuration setting connection-options. Add connection options to the client The application may have a need to change or add new gRPC settings. The application may add connection options to the client instance that may be new options or to override existing default connection options stored in the system configuration. See the above discussion on how to change the options within the system configuration. const new_options = { 'grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms': 10000 }; client.addConnectionOptions(new_options); // peer will have options from default and from client const peer = client.newPeer(url, options); // discovered peers will have options from default and from client channel.initialize({discover: true, target: peer}); Note: All new connections created by this client, including those created automatically when using the discovery service will use the client's connection options to override the default connection options. Add connection options on create The application may need unique connection options for individual peers or orderers. Unique settings may be passed on the Client#newPeer or Client#newOrderer calls in the option parameter. Options passed in on the call will override both the client based options and the system configuration based options. const options = { pem: '&lt;pem string&gt;', 'ssl-target-name-override': 'myhost.org1.com', 'grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms': 10000 }; // peer will have options from default, client, and parameter const peer = client.newPeer(url, options); Note: Connection options passed on the newPeer() and the newOrderer() calls will only be used for that peer or orderer. Add connection options to a common connection profile Connection options may be set at the client level or individually on peers and orderers when using a common connection profile. In the following profile both the client section and one peer have a gRPC setting. client: # Which organization does this application instance belong to? The value is the name of an org # defined under \"organizations\" organization: Org1 # set connection timeouts for the peer and orderer for the client connection: timeout: peer: # the timeout in seconds to be used on requests to a peer, # for example 'sendTransactionProposal' endorser: 120 # the timeout in seconds to be used by applications when waiting for an # event to occur. This time should be used in a javascript timer object # that will cancel the event registration with the channel event hub instance. eventHub: 60 # the timeout in seconds to be used when setting up the connection # with the peer event hub. If the peer does not acknowledge the # connection within the time, the application will be notified over the # error callback if provided. eventReg: 3 # the timeout in seconds to be used on request to the orderer, # for example orderer: 30 # connection options, typically these will be common GRPC settings, # overriding what has been set in the system config file \"default.json\" options: grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms: 10000 peers: peer1.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer1.org2.example.com grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms: 20000 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/c... peer2.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8052 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer2.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/c... Note: All new connections created by this client, including those created automatically when using the discovery service will use the client's connection options to override the default connection options. peer1 will be override the one setting with it's own unique value. peer2 will not override any of the client's or the system defaults. The application may call the client.addConnectionOptions() to add additional settings or override settings.

For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration Service Discovery The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript promise and async await. Overview The fabric-client provides the ability for custom code that will handle the endorsement process and the submitting of endorsements to the orderer. There are two plug points defined, one on the Channel#sendTransactionProposal and one on the Channel#sendTransaction. The fabric-client will pass control to the handler to complete the processing. The custom code may decide to retry, try another end point, or use discovery to complete the task. see fabric-client: How to use the discovery service on how the default handlers are used with discovery. Modified API's that will use handlers channel.initialize() - This method has been enhanced to instantiate instances of the handlers for use by the channel. The method will get the paths from the system configuration settings to create and initialize them. channel.sendTransactionProposal() - This method has been enhanced to use an endorsement-handler if one has been instantiated and initialized. channel.sendTransaction() - This method has been enhanced to use a commit-handler if one has been instantiated and initialized. New configuration settings endorsement-handler - string - The path to the endorsement handler. Allows for a custom handler to be used. This handler is used in the sendTransactionProposal() method to determine the target peers and how to send the proposal. (default 'fabric-client/lib/impl/DiscoveryEndorsementHandler.js') commit-handler - string - The path to the commit handler. Allows for a custom handler to be used. This handler is used in the sendTransaction() method to determine the orderers and how to send the transaction to be committed. (default 'fabric-client/lib/impl/BasicCommitHandler.js') new Endorsement Handler The sending of a proposal to be endorsed may be done using custom code. The fabric-client will use by default the file called DiscoveryEndorsementHandler. A different endorsement handler may be used by changing the configuration setting \"endorsement-handler\" with the setConfigSetting() or placing a new line in configuration JSON file that application has applied to the fabric-client configuration. This will instantiate a handler located at the path provide in the attribute for all channels initialized after the call. The default handler was designed to be used with discovery to provided automatic selection of peers and fail over. When used without discovery the handler will only send to the peers as defined in the targets parameter without fail over. The handler may also be changed using the endorsementHandler attribute on the channel.initialize() request call parameter. This will instantiate a handler located at the path provide in the attribute just for this channel. // set value in memory Client.setConfigSetting('endorsement-handler', '/path/to/the/handler.js'); --or-- // the path to an additional config file Client.addConfigFile('/path/to/config.json'); // the json file contains the following line // \"endorsement-handler\": \"/path/to/the/handler.js\" --or-- const request = { ... endorsementHandler: \"/path/to/the/handler.js\", ... } // initialize must be run to use handlers. channel.initialize(request); A endorsement handler must implement the api.EndorsementHandler. When the channel is initialized, the channel will read the path setting and create an instance of the handler for use by the new channel instance. new CommitHandler The sending of the endorsements to be committed may be done using custom code. The fabric-client will use by default the file called BasicCommitHandler. The commit handler may be changed by changing the configuration setting \"commit-handler\" by doing a setConfigSetting() or placing a new line in configuration JSON file that application has applied to the fabric-client configuration. The default handler was designed to be used with discovery to provided automatic selection of orderers and fail over. When used without discovery the handler will still provide fail over to all orderers assigned to the channel, sending to each one in orderer until an orderer response successfully to the transaction submission. The handler may also be changed using the commitHandler attribute on the channel.initialize() request call parameter. This will instantiate a handler located at the path provide in the attribute just for this channel. // set the config value in memory Client.setConfigSetting('commit-handler', '/path/to/the/handler.js'); --or-- // path of an additional config file Client.addConfigFile('/path/to/config.json'); // the json file contains the following line // \"commit-handler\": \"/path/to/the/handler.js\" --or-- const request = { ... commitHandler: \"/path/to/the/handler.js\", ... } // initialize must be run to use handlers. channel.initialize(request); A commit handler must implement the api.CommitHandler. When the channel is initialized, the channel will read the path setting and create an instance of the handler for use by the new channel instance.

Overview There are three event types that can be subscribed to: Contract events - Those emitted explicitly by the chaincode developer within a transaction Transaction (Commit) events - Those emitted automatically when a transaction is committed after an invoke Block events - Those emitted automatically when a block is committed Listening for these events allows the application to react without directly calling a transaction. This is ideal in use cases such as monitoring network analytics. Usage Each listener type takes at least one parameter, the event callback. This is the function that is called when an event is received. The callback function given is expected to be a promise, meaning that the callback can perform asynchronous tasks without risking missing events. Options module:fabric-network.Network~EventListenerOptions. Note: Listeners will connect to event hubs and ask to receive unfiltered events by default. To receive filtered events, set EventListenerOptions.filtered: true. Naming All event listeners (including CommitEventListeners, which use the transaction ID) must have a unique name at the Network level Contract events const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, gatewayOptions); const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); const contract = network.getContract('my-contract'); /** * @param {String} listenerName the name of the event listener * @param {String} eventName the name of the event being listened to * @param {Function} callback the callback function with signature (error, event, blockNumber, transactionId, status) * @param {module:fabric-network.Network~EventListenerOptions} options **/ const listener = await contract.addContractListener('my-contract-listener', 'sale', (err, event, blockNumber, transactionId, status) =&gt; { if (err) { console.error(err); return; } console.log(`Block Number: ${blockNumber} Transaction ID: ${transactionId} Status: ${status}`); }) Notice that there is no need to specify an event hub, as the EventHubSelectionStrategy will select it automatically. Block events const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, gatewayOptions); const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); /** * @param {String} listenerName the name of the event listener * @param {Function} callback the callback function with signature (error, blockNumber, transactionId, status) * @param {module:fabric-network.Network~EventListenerOptions} options **/ const listener = await network.addBlockListener('my-block-listener', (error, block) =&gt; { if (err) { console.error(err); return; } console.log(`Block: ${block}`); }); When listening for block events, it is important to specify if you want a filtered or none filtered event, as this determines which event hub is compatible with the request. Commit events Note: The listener listener name is transactionId.&lt;some random string&gt; There are two methods for subscribing to a transaction commit event. Using module:fabric-network.Network and directly, using module:fabric-network.Transaction. Using module:fabric-network.Transaction directly, abstracts away the need to specify which transaction ID you wish to listen for. Option 1 const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, gatewayOptions); const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); const contract = network.getContract('my-contract'); const transaction = contract.newTransaction('sell'); /** * @param {String} transactionId the transaction ID * @param {Function} callback the callback function with signature (error, transactionId, status, blockNumber) * @param {Object} options **/ const listener = await network.addCommitListener(transaction.getTransactionID().getTransactionID(), (err, transactionId, status, blockNumber) =&gt; { if (err) { console.error(err); return; } console.log(`Transaction ID: ${transactionId} Status: ${status} Block number: ${blockNumber}`); }); Option 2 const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, gatewayOptions); const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); const contract = network.getContract('my-contract'); const transaction = contract.newTransaction('sell'); /** * @param {String} transactionId the transaction ID * @param {Function} callback the callback function with signature (error, transactionId, status, blockNumber) * @param {Object} options **/ const listener = await transaction.addCommitListener((err, transactionId, status, blockNumber) =&gt; { if (err) { console.error(err); return; } console.log(`Transaction ID: ${transactionId} Status: ${status} Block number: ${blockNumber}`); }); Both Network.addCommitListener and Contract.addCommitListener have an optional eventHub parameter. When set, the listener will only listen to that event hub, and in the event of an unforeseen disconnect, it will try and to reconnect without using the EventHubSelectionStrategy. Checkpointing fabric-network: How to replay missed events Start Block and End Block In the module:fabric-network~EventListenerOptions it is possible to specify a startBlock and an endBlock. This behaves in the same way as the same options on ChannelEventHub shown in the tutorial here fabric-client: How to use the channel-based event service. Using startBlock and endBlock disables event replay using a checkpointer for the events received by that listener. Unregistering listeners addContractListener, addBlockListener and addCommitListener return a ContractEventListener, BlockEventListener and CommitEventListener respectively. Each has an unregister() function that removes the listener from the event hub, meaning no further events will be received from that listener until register() is called again. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

As of v1.1 the only metadata are the indexes that may be added to a CouchDB state database of your channel ledger. For more information: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric setting up a CouchDB as the state database The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. Overview Fabric 1.1 has introduced the capability of defining indexes in a CouchDB state database to help improve performance of your queries made in your chaincode. The index definitions need to be in JSON format and in files with a .json extension. These definitions will be included in the chaincode installation package that is sent to the Fabric peer. Modified API's that allow for metadata client.installChaincode() - There is a new attribute ('metadataPath') that may be included in the installation request. The value of the metadataPath is a string representing the absolute path to the directory structure containing the JSON index files. Installing chaincode The following example will install the chaincode 'my_chaincode' and include index files. let targets = buildTargets(); //build the list of peers that will require this chaincode let chaincode_path = path.resolve(__dirname, '../chaincode/src/node_cc/my_chaincode'); let metadata_path = path.resolve(__dirname, '../chaincode/my_indexes'); // send proposal to install var request = { targets: targets, chaincodePath: chaincode_path, metadataPath: metadata_path, // notice this is the new attribute of the request chaincodeId: 'my_chaincode', chaincodeType: 'node', chaincodeVersion: 'v1' }; client.installChaincode(request).then((results) =&gt; { var proposalResponses = results[0]; // check the results }, (err) =&gt; { console.log('Failed to send install proposal due to error: ' + err.stack ? err.stack : err); throw new Error('Failed to send install proposal due to error: ' + err.stack ? err.stack : err); }); The following shows the path used as the metadataPath above. This is the required directory structure required under the path. The indexes directory will hold the files with the index definitions.

Connection profiles are a new feature of the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Client as of 1.1. A connection profile will describe the Hyperledger Fabric network to the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Client (fabric client). For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration cryptographic generation see cryptogen configuration transaction generator see configtxgen configuration translation tool see configtxlator The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. Overview A connection profile contain entries that describe the Hyperledger Fabric network including entries that describe the fabric client that will access the the network. The application will load a configuration file and then it will be used by fabric client to simplify the steps needed to setup and use the network. The connection profile has specific addresses and settings of network items. Resources like javascript classes to instantiate are stored in the fabric client's configuration system. It will be easier to work with a fabric client loaded with a connection profile configuration because it reduces the setup before calling an action. Parameters for items like targets may be specified by name and object will not have to be created and maintained before the action is called. On many calls if no target peer is specified, the fabric client will look to see if there is a Peer in the role needed for the action. API's to load a connection profile Client.loadFromConfig() - A static utility method to get a fabric client instance loaded with the connection profile configuration. client.loadFromConfig() - A fabric client instance method to load a connection profile configuration, overriding any existing connection profile configuration settings that may have been set when this client object was created by the call above. new API's that use a loaded connection profile client.initCredentialStores() - A fabric client instance method to create a state store and assign it to the fabric client instance based on the current settings in the loaded connection profile configuration. It will also create the crypto suite and assign it to the fabric client instance. A crypto store will be created and assigned to crypto suite if needed. (HSM based crypto suites do not require a crypto store). client.setTlsClientCertAndKey(clientCert, clientKey) -A fabric client instance method that will set a certificate and the corresponding private key on the client instance. Mutual TLS client settings are not stored within the connection profile. When a peer or orderer instance is created for the user from the endpoints defined in the connection profile, these settings will be used as the client mutual TLS settings. When using mutual TLS and a connection profile, this method must be called before endpoints are required. Calling this method is only required when using mutual TLS and a connection profile. channel.newChannelEventHub() - A fabric channel instance method to create an channel-based event hub based on the current settings in the loaded connection profile configuration of the named peer. channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg() - A fabric channel instance method to return a list of channel-based event hubs that are associated with an organizations. Peers in an organizations that have the eventSource set to true will be returned. client.getPeersForOrg() - A fabric client instance method to return a list of peer objects that are associated with an organizations. Modified API's that will use the connection profile configuration if one has been loaded client.getChannel() - A fabric client instance method that will create a channel instance object based on the settings for a channel defined in the currently loaded connection profile configuration. client.newTransactionID(&lt;boolean&gt;) - This method was modified to allow for a boolean to indicate that the transaction id generated should be based on the administrative identity if one has been assigned rather than the user context assigned to the fabric client. client.setUserContext() - Now allows username and password as a parameter or a User object. When username and password are used the fabric client will perform an enroll with the certificate authority using the username and password. client.installChaincode() - If the targets parameter is excluded from the request parameter list then the peers defined in the current organization of the client will be used. client.queryXXXX() - The query API's will now take a peer name (as defined in the connection profile config) or peer object instance as the target. channel.instantiateChaincode() - If the targets parameter is excluded from the request parameter list then the peers defined in the current organization of the client that are also on this channel will be used. channel.sendTransactionProposal() The request object parameter may use names for targets or let the fabric client find peers to use for targets as defined in the connection profile configuration. channel.sendTransaction() The request object parameter may use orderer name or let the fabric client find an orderer to use as defined in the connection profile configuration. channel.queryXXXX() - All the query API's will now take a peer name as the target rather than an peer instance object. Loading connection profile configurations The application code can either point to a yaml or json file that contains the configuration information or it may pass a Javascript object directory to the API's to load a configuration. For convenience there is a static utility method on the fabric-client to create a new fabric client object and load a connection profile configuration at the same time. There is also a method on the fabric client instance that may be used to load a connection profile configuration on top of an existing connection profile configuration. The following example will create a new instance of the fabric-client and load a connection profile configuration. However in this case the connection profile configuration does not contain any information about the client side of the fabric network, just the fabric network elements. var client = Client.loadFromConfig('test/fixtures/network.yaml'); Here is the connection profile definition loaded name: \"Network\" version: \"1.0\" channels: mychannel: orderers: - orderer.example.com peers: peer0.org1.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: true ledgerQuery: true eventSource: true peer0.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: false ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false organizations: Org1: mspid: Org1MSP peers: - peer0.org1.example.com certificateAuthorities: - ca-org1 adminPrivateKey: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/keystore/9022d671ceedbb24af3ea69b5a8136cc64203df6b9920e26f48123fcfcb1d2e9_sk signedCert: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/signcerts/Admin@org1.example.com-cert.pem Org2: mspid: Org2MSP peers: - peer0.org2.example.com certificateAuthorities: - ca-org2 adminPrivateKey: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/keystore/5a983ddcbefe52a7f9b8ee5b85a590c3e3a43c4ccd70c7795bec504e7f74848d_sk signedCert: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/signcerts/Admin@org2.example.com-cert.pem orderers: orderer.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:7050 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: orderer.example.com grpc-max-send-message-length: 4194304 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/tlscacerts/example.com-cert.pem peers: peer0.org1.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:7051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com grpc.keepalive_time_ms: 600000 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tlscacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem peer0.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tlscacerts/org2.example.com-cert.pem certificateAuthorities: ca-org1: url: https://localhost:7054 httpOptions: verify: false tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/org1.example.com-cert.pem registrar: - enrollId: admin enrollSecret: adminpw caName: caorg1 ca-org2: url: https://localhost:8054 httpOptions: verify: false tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/ca/org2.example.com-cert.pem registrar: - enrollId: admin enrollSecret: adminpw caName: caorg2 The following example will have an existing fabric client load a connection profile configuration. The definition will only contain client side definitions and no fabric network definitions. The client may load a new profile at anytime, it will overlay the top level sections it contains of those previously loaded. In this case the file being loaded only has a client section, therefore the loaded definition will now have the previously loaded channels, organizations, peers, orderers, and certificateAuthorities section definitions and the newly loaded client section definition. This allows for an existing fabric client to be able to work within different organization. Notice this client definition contains a connection section with an options attribute in the client section. Settings defined here will be applied to new peer and orderer instances the client creates. This will include peers and orderers that will be created automatically when using the discovery service. Peers and Orderers may override these connection settings in their grpcOptions settings. Note: The fabric-client grpc-max-send-message-length and grpc-max-receive-message-length defaults are -1 (unlimited). client.loadFromConfig('test/fixtures/org1.yaml'); Here is the client definition loaded above name: \"Org1 Client\" version: \"1.0\" client: organization: Org1 credentialStore: path: \"/tmp/hfc-kvs/org1\" cryptoStore: path: \"/tmp/hfc-cvs/org1\" connection: options grpc.keepalive_time_ms: 120000 Setup the stores The next step is to set up the client object with the state and crypto stores. If the client section of the connection profile configuration has these defined then it is a simple matter of running the following. This API is promise based, notice that we will need a .then on the returned promise to have it actually execute. This API does not return anything, however it has created a state store and assigned it to the client, it has created a CryptoSuite and also assigned it to the client, and created a crypto store and assigned that to the crypto suite. Notice the credentialStore and cryptoStore definitions above in the client section of the connection profile configuration. In this case we are using two different locations, it may be easier to have these in the same locations when first starting out. The following will create two stores and a CryptoSuite and assign them to the fabric client all based on the loaded configurations. client.initCredentialStores() .then((nothing) =&gt; { Work with user context When there is certificate Authority information on the organization, the fabric client may be used to simplify the enrollment and user context creation. The application will still have to register new users with the certificate authority, however when a connection profile configuration has been loaded there a simpler way to get a certificate authority client. So first let's enroll an admin user so that we have the credentials (crypto material) needed to interact with the certificate authority and the fabric network. The following convenience method will first look in the state store (as defined above) to see if the user exist. If the user is not found and there is a connection profile configuration loaded, the fabric client will build a certificate authority client object as defined in the fabric client configuration with the address as defined in the currently loaded connection profile configuration. The fabric client uses the certificate authority client to enroll the admin user with the certificate authority, this requires that a new set of keys be generated on the client side. The fabric client will then use the signed certificate returned by the certificate authority from the enroll to create a user context. The context will then be assign it to fabric client and stored in the state store along with storing the keys in the crypto store. At this point the fabric client is ready to interact with the fabric network and the application may use the returned user object to interact with the certificate authority. In the following example we are able to enroll the user because it known by the certificate authority. New users will have to be registered first. client.setUserContext({username:'admin', password:'adminpw'}) .then((admin) =&gt; { The following example will have the fabric client build a certificate authority client based on the currently loaded connection profile configuration by first finding which organization defined in the client section and then finding the certificate authority associated with that organization. var fabric_ca_client = client.getCertificateAuthority(); Then once we have a fabric-ca-client, we will be able to register new users. We could also use the fabric-ca-client to enroll users and make a few calls to the fabric client to create a user object and then assign that user object to the fabric client, but it will be much easier to just use the convenience method of the fabric client instance. Notice how we have to use the 'admin' user object returned from the client.setUserContext() to do the register. The admin user object has the credentials needed to the register. Then notice we called the same setUserContext method as we did with the admin above, this will have the fabric client object assigned with the 'user1' user context thus providing the credentials to interact with the fabric network. Note that the setUserContext also stores the user context which contains the signed certificate from the certificate authority and newly created public and private keys of the now enrolled user. fabric_ca_client.register({enrollmentID: 'user1', affiliation: 'org1'}, admin) .then((secret) =&gt; { return client.setUserContext({username:'user1', password:secret}); }).then((user)=&gt; { Work with mutual TLS When your network is using mutual TLS, the client certificate and private key must be available to the client instance before the endpoints are automatically built. The client instance will be able to pass the required material to the endpoint instance that is needed to establish the connection. The example shown will also retrieve the material. These steps must be performed before any actions on the fabric network. // get the CA associated with this client's organization let fabric_ca_client = client.getCertificateAuthority(); let request = { enrollmentID: 'user1', enrollmentSecret: secret, profile: 'tls' }; // make the request to build the keys and get the certificate fabric_ca_client.enroll(request) .then((enrollment) =&gt; { // Successfully called the Certificate Authority to get the TLS material let key = enrollment.key.toBytes(); let cert = enrollment.certificate; // set the material on the client to be used when building endpoints for the user client.setTlsClientCertAndKey(cert, key); ... When an admin is needed Notice in the organizations section of the connection profile configuration that an organization may have a signed cert setting and admin private key setting that are associated with the organization. This is a convenience for your organization such that operations that require a fabric network administrator will be able to get one easily. These credentials will be assigned to the fabric client when the configuration is loaded. If one has not been assigned than the current user context assigned to the fabric client is assumed to be an administrator. There is also a convenience method on the client object that will assign credentials to the client to be used for operations that require an admin. client.setAdminSigningIdentity('admin privateKey','admin cert'); Assume that a common connection profile has been loaded, setting up both an organization with an admin and indicating that the client is in that organization. Then when the call is made to get a transaction id object, the fabric client will check to see if an admin has been assigned to the fabric client and use that to generate the transaction id. The transaction id returned will be tagged that it was generated with the assigned administrative identity. Notice how the request object being built is using just a name for the orderer rather than an Orderer object. The fabric client will look up this name in the loaded connection profile configuration. When the createChannel call is made, the fabric client will know that this action should be signed by the administrative identity because the transaction id was marked as an admin based transaction. Note that the administrative signing identity is not required if the logged in user is an administrative user and has been assigned to the fabric client. let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(true); let request = { config: config, signatures : signatures, name : channel_name, orderer : 'orderer.example.com', txId : tx_id }; return client.createChannel(request); }).then((result) =&gt; { When a peer is needed Notice how a peer is added to an organization, it is more than just a reference to the actual peer definition, the peer is also defined to have roles within that organization. peer0.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: false ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false This peer may be used to endorse transaction, but not used to run chaincode queries. This peer may be used to audit the channel by making ledger based queries (like queryBlock), but may not be used to be an event source. Of course this combination of roles does not make much sense in real life. So let's have a look at a chaincode invoke endorsement let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); var request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id }; channel.sendTransactionProposal(request) .then((results) =&gt; { Notice that we have left off the targets parameter of the request object. This will have the fabric client do a lookup of peers on this channel in the connection profile configuration. The fabric client will be looking for peers defined in the role of endorsingPeer. The fabric client will then send the proposal to the located peers and return all the endorsements in the results object. There may be a need to have only the peers in a specific organization. Use the mspid of the organization. var peers = getPeersForOrg('Org1MSP'); Or maybe for the organization that is defined in the client section of the connection profile. var peers = getPeersForOrg(); When an orderer is needed After receiving endorsements from the peers for a transaction proposal, they will need to be sent to an orderer along with the proposal for a transaction to be committed to the ledger. var request = { proposalResponses: proposalResponses, proposal: proposal }; channel.sendTransaction(request) .then((results) =&gt; { Notice that an orderer to send this transaction to is not included in the request object. The orderer defined in the connection profile configuration will be used. When doing queries When there is a connection profile configuration loaded and the query call is not passed a target peer to use, the fabric client will look in the connection profile configuration for a peer to use. These are fabric client based queries and require the user have an admin role or indicate that the admin identity should be used. These queries do not use the connection profile config lookup to find a peer to use and must be passed the target peer. queryChannels queryInstalledChaincodes These queries are channel based queries that require a peer with the ledgerQuery role. queryInstantiatedChaincodes (user must be an admin or indicate that the assigned admin identity should be used) queryInfo queryBlockByHash queryBlock queryTransaction this is a channel based query and requires a peer with the chaincodeQuery role. queryByChaincode When monitoring for events Working with an channel-based event hub will not changed when a connection profile configuration has been loaded. A new method has been added to the fabric client to simplify setting up of an ChannelEventHub object. Use the following to get an ChannelEventHub object that will be setup to work with the named peer's channel-based event hub. var channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub('peer0.org1.example.com'); Notice how the parameter to the call is the name of the peer. All settings to create an channel-based event hub are defined by the connection profile configuration under the peer by that name. peer0.org1.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:7051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com grpc.keepalive_time_ms: 600000 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tlscacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem The following will be a list of event hubs that are within the 'Org1' organization. All peers referenced by an organization that the 'eventSource' set to true. Use the mspid of the organization. var channel_event_hubs = channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg('Org1MSP'); The following will be a list of channel-based event hubs that are within the organization defined in the client section of the connection profile. var channel_event_hubs = channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg(); What does the Fabric Client look for in a common connection profile The Fabric Client will be looking for the following key names and parameters for those keys: # # Schema version of the content. Used by the SDK to apply the parsing rules. # version: \"1.0\" # only supported version as of fabric-client v1.3.0 # # The client section is SDK-specific.

Starting in v1.2, Fabric offers the ability to create private data collections, which allows a subset of organizations on a channel to endorse, commit, or query private data without having to create a separate channel. For more information, refer to: Private Data Concept Private Data Architecture Using Private Data in Fabric Overview The following are the steps to use private data with the Node.js SDK (fabric-client). Check out the sections below for details on these steps. Create a collection definition json file Implement chaincode to store and query private data Install and instantiate chaincode with a collection definition Invoke chaincode to store and query private data Purge private data Query for a collection definition Create a collection definition json file A collection definition describes who can persist data, how many peers the data is distributed to, how many peers are required to disseminate the private data, and how long the private data is persisted in the private database. Chaincode APIs will map the collection to the private data by the collection name. A collection definition is composed of the following five properties. name: Name of the collection. policy: Defines the organization peers allowed to persist the collection data. requiredPeerCount: Number of peers required to disseminate the private data as a condition of the endorsement of the chaincode maxPeerCount: For data redundancy purposes, the number of other peers that the current endorsing peer will attempt to distribute the data to. If an endorsing peer goes down, these other peers are available at commit time if there are requests to pull the private data. blockToLive: For very sensitive information such as pricing or personal information, this value represents how long the data should live on the private database in terms of blocks. The data will be purged after this specified number of blocks on the private database. To keep private data indefinitely, that is, to never purge private data, set the blockToLive property to 0. Here is a sample collection definition JSON file, containing an array of two collection definitions: [ { \"name\": \"collectionMarbles\", \"policy\": { \"identities\": [ { \"role\": { \"name\": \"member\", \"mspId\": \"Org1MSP\" } }, { \"role\": { \"name\": \"member\", \"mspId\": \"Org2MSP\" } } ], \"policy\": { \"1-of\": [ { \"signed-by\": 0 }, { \"signed-by\": 1 } ] } }, \"requiredPeerCount\": 1, \"maxPeerCount\": 2, \"blockToLive\": 100 }, { \"name\": \"collectionMarblePrivateDetails\", \"policy\": { \"identities\": [ { \"role\": { \"name\": \"member\", \"mspId\": \"Org1MSP\" } } ], \"policy\": { \"1-of\": [ { \"signed-by\": 0 } ] } }, \"requiredPeerCount\": 1, \"maxPeerCount\": 1, \"blockToLive\": 100 } ] This example contains two private data collections: collectionMarbles and collectionMarblePrivateDetails. The policy property in the collectionMarbles definition allows all members of the channel (Org1 and Org2) to have the private data in a private database. The collectionMarblesPrivateDetails collection allows only members of Org1 to have the private data in their private database. For Node.js SDK, you must define policies in the same format as shown above. Implement chaincode to store and query private data Fabric provides chaincode APIs to store and query private data. As an example, check out marbles private data example to understand how to use the chaincode APIs to read and write private data. This example implements the following functions to manage private data. readMarble: query the values of the name, color, size and owner attributes using collection collectionMarbles. readMarblePrivateDetails: query the values of the price attribute using collection collectionMarblePrivateDetails. initMarble: store private data for the collections. delete: delete a marble from private database. Install and instantiate chaincode with a collection definition Client applications interact with the blockchain ledger through chaincode. As such we need to install and instantiate the chaincode on every peer that will execute and endorse transactions. When instantiated a chaincode on a channel the collection will be associated with that chaincode. Install chaincode. No specific parameter needed to support private data. Instantiate chaincode. To support private data, the request must include the collections-config attribute. const collectionsConfigPath = path.resolve(__dirname, collection_definition_json_filepath); const request = { targets: peers, chaincodeId: chaincodeId, chaincodeType: chaincodeType, chaincodeVersion: chaincodeVersion, fcn: functionName, args: args, txId: tx_id, 'collections-config': collectionsConfigPath }; const endorsementResults = await channel.sendInstantiateProposal(request, time_out); // additional code needed to validate endorsementResults and send transaction to commit ...... Invoke chaincode to store and query private data You must be authorized to transact with the private data based on the policy defined in collection definition. Recall that the above collection definition allows all members of Org1 and Org2 to access collectionMarbles (name, color, size, and owner) in their private database, but only peers in Org1 can have access to collectionMarblePrivateDetails (price) in their private database. Acting as a member of Org1, you can do the following with marbles private data example, Invoke initMarble to create a marble with private data. Invoke readMarble to read name, color, size and owner from the private database for collectionMarbles. Invoke readMarblePrivateDetails to read price from the private database for collectionMarblePrivateDetails. Purge private data The Hyperledger Fabric allows client applications to optionally purge the private data in a collection by setting the blockToLive property. This option may be needed when private data include personal or confidential information and transacting parties want to have a limited lifespan for the data. When blockToLive is set to a non-zero value in the collection definition file, Fabric will automatically purge the related private data after the specified number of blocks are committed. Client applications do not need to call any API. Query for a collection definition The Hyperledger Fabric allows client applications to query a peer for collection definitions. The Node.js SDK (fabric-client) has an API that will query a Hyperledger Fabric Peer for a collection definition associated with a chaincode running on the specified channel. See Channel#queryCollectionsConfig for detailed information. const request = { chaincodeId: chaincodeId, target: peer }; try { const response = await channel.queryCollectionsConfig(request); // response contains an array of collection definitions return response; } catch (error) { throw error; } Include private data in a transaction invocation The client application must put all private data into the transient data of the proposal request if the application wishes to keep the data private. Transient data is not returned in the endorsement results, only the hash of the transient data is returned in the endorsement created by the peer. The chaincode executed during the endorsement will be responsible for pulling the private data from the transient area of the proposal request and then work with the private data store of the peer. Example using fabric-network API // Private data sent as transient data: { [key: string]: Buffer } const transientData = { marblename: Buffer.from('marble1'), color: Buffer.from('red'), owner: Buffer.from('John'), size: Buffer.from('85'), price: Buffer.from('99') }; const result = await contract.createTransaction('initMarble') .setTransient(transientData) .submit(); Example using fabric-client API // private data const transient_data = { 'marblename': Buffer.from('marble1'), // string &lt;-&gt; byte[] 'color': Buffer.from('red'), // string &lt;-&gt; byte[] 'owner': Buffer.from('John'), // string &lt;-&gt; byte[] 'size': Buffer.from('85'), // string &lt;-&gt; byte[] 'price': Buffer.from('99') // string &lt;-&gt; byte[] }; const tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); const request = { chaincodeId : chaincodeId, txId: tx_id, fcn: 'initMarble', args: [], // all data is transient data transientMap: transient_data // private data }; // results will not contain the private data const endorsementResults = await channel.sendTransactionProposal(request); × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

Query handling strategies The SDK provides several selectable strategies for how it should evaluate transactions on peers in the network. The available strategies are defined in DefaultQueryHandlerStrategies. The desired strategy is (optionally) specified as an argument to connect() on the Gateway, and is used for all transaction evaluations on Contracts obtained from that Gateway instance. If no query handling strategy is specified, MSPID_SCOPE_SINGLE is used by default. This will evaluate all transactions on the first peer from which is can obtain a response, and only switch to another peer if this peer fails. The default query timeout may be changed along with the query strategy. This value will be in seconds. const { Gateway, DefaultQueryHandlerStrategies } = require('fabric-network'); const connectOptions = { queryHandlerOptions: { timeout: 60, strategy: DefaultQueryHandlerStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_SINGLE } } const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectOptions); Plug-in query handlers If behavior is required that is not provided by the default query handling strategies, it is possible to implement your own query handling. This is achieved by specifying your own factory function as the query handling strategy. The factory function should return a query handler object and take one parameter: Blockchain network: Network The Network provides access to peers on which transactions should be evaluated. function createQueryHandler(network) { /* Your implementation here */ return new MyQueryHandler(peers); } const connectOptions = { queryHandlerOptions: { strategy: createQueryHandler } } const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectOptions); The query handler object returned must implement the following functions. class MyQueryHandler { /** * Evaluate the supplied query on appropriate peers. * @param {Query} query A query object that provides an evaluate() * function to invoke itself on specified peers. * @returns {Buffer} Query result. */ async evaluate(query) { /* Your implementation here */ } } For a complete sample plug-in query handler implementation, see sample-query-handler.ts. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. The transactional mechanics that take place during a standard asset exchange. transacton flow in fabric. The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in a PKI system. CSR The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript promise and async await. Overview In most use cases the fabric-client will persist the user's credentials including the private key and sign transactions for the user. However some business scenarios may require higher level of privacy. What if the user wants to keep their private key secret and does not trust another system or backend server to securely store it and use it? The fabric-client comes with the ability to sign a transaction with an offline private key. By contrast to call setUserContext() with the user's identity (which contains the user's private key), an alternative way is to split the sign a tx process out of the fabric-client and let the application layer choose the place to store the private key, sign the transaction and send the signed transaction back. By this approach, the fabric-client does not require the user's private key any more. The Fabric-ca comes with the ability to enroll with a PKCS#10 standard CSR, which means the user can use an existing key pairs to generate the CSR and send this CSR to Fabric-ca to get the signed certificate. The fabric-ca-client also accepts a CSR at the API enroll(). The transaction flow for signing a transaction offline The following will show the steps to signing a transaction offline: With the user's identity (cert and private key) set at the fabric client: Endorse -&gt; Channel.sendTransactionProposal() Commit -&gt; Channel.sendTransaction() ChannelEventHub -&gt; ChannelEventHub.connect() (if the channel-eventhub has not connected to the peers) Without the user's private key at the fabric client: Endorse: generate an unsigned transaction proposal with the identity's certificate -&gt; Channel.generateUnsignedProposal() sign the unsigned transaction proposal with the identity's private key offline producing a signed transaction proposal send the signed transaction proposal to the peer(s) and get endorsement(s) -&gt; Channel.sendSignedProposal() Commit: generate an unsigned transaction with the endorsements -&gt; Channel.generateUnsignedTransaction() sign the unsigned transaction with the identity's private key offline producing a signed transaction send the signed transaction to the orderer -&gt; Channel.sendSignedTransaction() Register Channel Event Listerner: If the channel event hub has not connected to the peer, the channel eventhub registration needs the private key's signature too. generate an unsigned eventhub registration for the ChannelEventHub -&gt; ChannelEventHub.generateUnsignedRegistration() sign the unsigned eventhub registration with the identity's private key offline producing a signed eventhub registration using the signed eventhub registration for the ChannelEventHub's registration -&gt; ChannelEventHub.connect({signedEvent}) How to sign a transaction by an identity's private key There might be several digital signature algorithms. If we set the user's identity at the fabric client, the fabric client would use ECDSA with algorithm 'EC' by default. Here is how this works with an offline private key. first, generate an unsigned transaction proposal with the identity's certificate const certPem = '&lt;PEM encoded certificate content&gt;'; const mspId = 'Org1MSP'; // the msp Id for this org const transactionProposal = { fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b', '100'], chaincodeId: 'mychaincodeId', channelId: 'mychannel', }; const { proposal, txId } = channel.generateUnsignedProposal(transactionProposal, mspId, certPem); // now we have the 'unsigned proposal' for this transaction calculate the hash of the transaction proposal bytes. A hash algorithm should be picked and calculate the hash of the transaction proposal bytes. There exists multiple hash functions (such as SHA2/3). by default, the fabric client will use 'SHA2' with key size 256. The user may use an alternative implementation const proposalBytes = proposal.toBuffer(); // the proposal comes from step 1 const hashFunction = xxxx; // A hash function by the user's desire const digest = hashFunction(proposalBytes); // calculate the hash of the proposal bytes calculate the signature for this transaction proposal We may have a series of choices for the signature algorithm. Including asymmetric keys (such as ECDSA or RSA), symmetric keys (such as AES). By default the the fabric client will use ECDSA with algorithm 'EC'. // This is a sample code for signing the digest from step 2 with EC. // Different signature algorithm may have different interfaces const elliptic = require('elliptic'); const { KEYUTIL } = require('jsrsasign'); const privateKeyPEM = '&lt;The PEM encoded private key&gt;'; const { prvKeyHex } = KEYUTIL.getKey(privateKeyPEM); // convert the pem encoded key to hex encoded private key const EC = elliptic.ec; const ecdsaCurve = elliptic.curves['p256']; const ecdsa = new EC(ecdsaCurve); const signKey = ecdsa.keyFromPrivate(prvKeyHex, 'hex'); const sig = ecdsa.sign(Buffer.from(digest, 'hex'), signKey); // now we have the signature, next we should send the signed transaction proposal to the peer const signature = Buffer.from(sig.toDER()); const signedProposal = { signature, proposal_bytes: proposalBytes, }; send the signed transaction proposal to peer(s) const sendSignedProposalReq = { signedProposal, targets }; const proposalResponses = await channel.sendSignedProposal(sendSignedProposalReq); // check the proposal responses, if all good, commit the transaction similar to step 1, generate an unsigned transaction const commitReq = { proposalResponses, proposal, }; const commitProposal = await channel.generateUnsignedTransaction(commitReq); similar to step 3, sign the unsigned transaction with the user's private key const signedCommitProposal = signProposal(commitProposal); commit the signed transaction const response = await channel.sendSignedTransaction({ signedProposal: signedCommitProposal, request: commitReq, }); // response.status should be 'SUCCESS' if the commit succeed similar to step 1, generate an unsigned eventhub registration for the ChannelEventHub. const unsignedEvent = eh.generateUnsignedRegistration({ certificate: certPem, mspId, }); similar to step 3, sign the unsigned eventhub registration with the user's private key const signedProposal = signProposal(unsignedEvent); const signedEvent = { signature: signedProposal.signature, payload: signedProposal.proposal_bytes, }; register this ChannelEventHub at peer channelEventHub.connect({signedEvent}); A full test can be found at fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/signTransactionOffline.js How to enroll with a CSR The fabric-ca-client provides the API enroll() that accepts an optional param 'CSR'. If the params does not contains CSR, fabric-ca-client will first generate a key pair, then use the user's enrollmentID as the common name to create a CSR which is signed with the new generated private key. The response will contain the private key object if no 'CSR' in enroll params. To enroll with a CSR, first we should call fabric-ca-client API register to register a new identity at Fabric-ca. After a successfully register, we have the enrollmentID and enrollmentSecret. Then we should create the CSR. A common way is using the openssl command. Notice the CSR must contain the information \"common name\" and the \"common name\" must be same as the \"enrollmentID\" at the register step. Here is an example of how to create a CSR with the key algorithm rsa and key size 2048 bits openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout test.key -out test.csr The test.csr from the above command is represented as a Base64 encoded PKCS#10. Here is how we call enroll with a CSR const fs = require('fs'); const csr = fs.readFileSync('the path to test.csr', 'utf8'); const req = { enrollmentID: enrollmentID, enrollmentSecret: enrollmentSecret, csr: csr, }; const enrollment = await caService.enroll(req); // the enrollment.certificate contains the signed certificate from Fabric-ca × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

Overview The submit of a transaction involves several steps: Send proposals to endorsing peers. Send the endorsed transaction to the orderer. The transaction is eventually committed on all peers in the network. In some cases a client application might be happy to proceed immediately after the transaction is successfully sent to the orderer. In other cases a client application might need to ensure that the transaction has been committed on certain peers with which it wants to interact before proceeding. It is important to note that the blockchain state visible from a specific peer will remain unchanged until a transaction is committed on that peer. If a client application queries a peer for state after an endorsed transaction has been successfully sent to the orderer but before the transaction has been committed on that peer, the state returned will still be that prior to the transaction. For example, a query of a bank balance after a transaction to deduct funds from that bank account is submitted to the orderer will return the old balance until the transaction is eventually committed on the peer being queried. Event handling strategies The SDK provides several selectable strategies for how it should wait for commit events following a transaction invocation. The available strategies are defined in DefaultEventHandlerStrategies. The desired strategy is (optionally) specified as an argument to connect() on the Gateway, and is used for all transaction invocations on Contracts obtained from that Gateway instance. If no event handling strategy is specified, MSPID_SCOPE_ALLFORTX is used by default. const { Gateway, DefaultEventHandlerStrategies } = require('fabric-network'); const connectOptions = { eventHandlerOptions: { strategy: DefaultEventHandlerStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ALLFORTX } } const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectOptions); Specifying null as the event handling strategy will cause transaction invocations to return immediately after successfully sending the endorsed transaction to the orderer. It will not wait for any commit events to be received from peers. For more details on Event Handling Options, see DefaultEventHandlerOptions. Plug-in event handlers If behavior is required that is not provided by the default event handling strategies, it is possible to implement your own event handling. This is achieved by specifying your own factory function as the event handling strategy. The factory function should return a transaction event handler object and take two parameters: Transaction: Transaction Blockchain network: Network The Network provides access to peers and event hubs from which events should be recieved. function createTransactionEventHandler(transactionId, network) { /* Your implementation here */ return new MyTransactionEventHandler(transactionId, eventHubs); } const connectOptions = { eventHandlerOptions: { strategy: createTransactionEventhandler } } const gateway = new Gateway(); await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectOptions); For more details on Event Handling Options, see DefaultEventHandlerOptions. The transaction event handler object returned must implement the following lifecycle functions. class MyTransactionEventHandler { /** * Called to initiate listening for transaction events. * @async * @throws {Error} if not in a state where the handling strategy can be satified and the transaction should * be aborted. For example, if insufficient event hubs are available. */ async startListening() { /* Your implementation here */ } /** * Wait until enough events have been received from the event hubs to satisfy the event handling strategy. * @async * @throws {Error} if the transaction commit is not successfully confirmed. */ async waitForEvents() { /* Your implementation here */ } /** * Cancel listening for events. */ cancelListening() { /* Your imeplementation here */ } } For a complete sample plug-in event handler implementation, see sample-transaction-event-handler.js. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2023-01-19T15:43:49+00:00 using the DocStrap template.
