## Hyperledger Fabric-CA Client for Node.js

SDK for writing node.js applications to interact with [Hyperledger Fabric CA](http://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html).

> **Note:** This API is deprecated as of Fabric v2.5. When developing applications for Hyperledger Fabric v2.4 and later, you should use the [Fabric Gateway client API](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/).

This package encapsulates the APIs to interact with the Fabric CA to manage user certificates lifecycle such as register, enroll, renew and revoke.

Additional packages are also provided:
1. `fabric-network`, to provide APIs to connect to a Fabric network, submit transactions and perform queries against the ledger.
2. `fabric-common`, encapsulates the common code used by all fabric-sdk-node packages supporting fine grain interactions with the Fabric network to send transaction invocations
3. `fabric-protos`, encapsulates the Protocol Buffer files and generated JavaScript classes for Hyperledger Fabric
